part of this video is sponsored by

LastPass more about LastPass at the end

of the show this is a video about

research into slowing the rate of Aging

and extending the human lifespan so

before I film this I wanted to know what

do you guys generally think about such

research and I made a Twitter poll where

I found that the majority of people were

supportive and thought there should be

more of it but there were some important

concerns and I want to address those

here at the beginning I mean the most

significant concern was if we're looking

to extend human lifespan does that just

mean we'll have more sick years where

we'll be in bed with Alzheimer's nobody

wants that and that was clear to me but

the professor that I was interviewing

for this video professor David Sinclair

points out that as you get older the

risk of Horrible diseases things like

diabetes and cancer and arthritis all

those sorts of things it increases

exponentially and so if this research is

successful the whole point of it will be

to forestall those sorts of diseases I

mean if you really are tackling aging

then you should also see that those

age-related diseases do not set in so

quickly

so the point of slowing aging and

extending human lifespan is to extend

the healthy lifespan also called the

health span the other concerns I saw

were that people were saying well this

could be used only for the wealthy and

increase inequality or it could increase

the population of the earth causing you

know garbage more co2 you know where the

resources to feed all these people I

think these are valid concerns but

they're not part of the scope of this

video so if you want to discuss them in

the comments feel free but the point of

this video is to address can we slow

aging in humans can we extend the

lifespan and the health span and what

does that look like how do we do it okay

so for this video I traveled up to the

bodega Marine Lab which is north of San

Francisco and there I got to see some

moon jellyfish now it's fascinating

about these moon jellyfishes some people

consider them and more

how can that be so all these jellyfish

have this complex life cycle where they

start off as a polyp which is basically

like a small sea anemone and then

they'll go through a metamorphosis and

become a Medusa and the Medusa stage is

what we generally think of when we think

about a jellyfish and in most of these

species the polyps are generally able to

asexually reproduce and they can

regenerate if tissue is cut off of them

or if they're damaged and they don't

have any clear evidence of senescence

which is the term for biological aging

so they appear to have some degree of

immortality no one had reported their

ability to do this until I think this

was 2015 so do moon jellyfish hold the

key to slowing aging and extending our

lifespan could they help us live forever

before I got into making this video I

would have put this sort of research in

the same category as downloading your

brain your consciousness into a computer

like I can see how maybe that would work

but I don't think we're anywhere near

that because we don't even understand

how the brain works or how memories are

stored so that seems like serious

science fiction so I would have put say

extending the human lifespan to 120 150

and Beyond in the same category but

after reading professor Sinclair's book

and doing an interview with him I think

it seems much more possible and in fact

plausible that will make some progress

over controlling Aging in our lifetimes

now if you want to slow aging the first

question you need to answer is why do we

age in the first place I mean what

really is aging I've made a video in the

past about telomeres these are the end

caps on your chromosomes and every time

a cell divides the telomere gets a bit

shorter so it was thought that these

telomeres are kind of like the tips of

your shoelaces and they prevent the

chromosome from fraying but there are

other signs in older bodies that you

have old cells there are an accumulation

of things they're called senescent cells

they're essentially these zombie-like

stels that just go on living in your

body and inflaming the cells around them

there's poor intercellular communication

there's mitochondrial dysfunction those

are the powerhouses of the cell there

are these eight or nine different

features of older cells and they are the

hallmarks of aging but the question is

are they the cause of aging or are they

kind of the result of a deeper root

cause in the middle of the last century

the hypothesis was that it was damaged

to our DNA mutations to our DNA that

happened of the course of our lives that

led us to be older but evidence since

then has suggested that that is not

really the case when you can take an

adult cell and you can clone it into a

new organism and that organism appears

to live about as long as non cloned

organisms of the same species

now the first shaped Dolly the sheep had

a short lifespan

she died early but cloned animals you

can now clone a monkey you can clone

dogs in fact barbra streisand the

actress she cloned her dogs and they're

expected to live a normal lifespan so in

that way it seems like all the

information is still there in the DNA so

if we're not losing information in our

DNA then what is the reason for aging

well professor Sinclair suspects that

it's a loss of information but not the

information in our DNA in our genome no

professor Sinclair suspects that the

loss of information is in our EPI genome

so what is the epigenome every cell in

your body has the same DNA but different

cell types have different epigenomes

they have different ways of packaging

that DNA coiling up you know a lot of it

so that it's not red and leaving some

parts of the DNA spooled out so it's

easier to transcribe and turn into

proteins and run that cell so the

epigenome is responsible for turning on

or turning off different parts of the

DNA the way it does that is with

proteins called histones that

essentially the DNA is wrapped on

and also things like methylation so

there's these chemical signaling markers

which are placed on the DNA in certain

positions so the idea is when your body

is first forming the epigenome is what

tells your cells what type of cell to be

but as you get older

professor Sinclair's hypothesis is that

we are losing information in the

epigenome and that's important because

if a skin cell needs to remain a skin

cell that's the epigenome

and if you don't have the epigenome the

skin cell will forget what type of cell

it is and it might turn into a brain

cell which may not be that bad but if

your brain turns into a skin cell you've

got a problem and I think that's largely

what aging is I've gotta say like

there's some weird like hair patches

like on my shoulder that have happened

as I've gotten older is that a cell like

doing the wrong thing are those meant to

be skin cells so they screwing up or is

this just some I don't know no no weird

stuff happens when you get older right

you start to get hair growing where it

shouldn't ears nose back that's cells

losing their identity cells go I can't

remember what I'm supposed to do I'm not

reading the right genes anymore so the

key to this sort of breakdown of the

epigenome is DNA damage yeah so when you

go out in the Sun and not like today but

on a day where there's a lot of Sun

you'll break your chromosomes and in the

effort that the cells go to to stick the

chromosome back together note the DNA

isn't just flailing around it's actually

bundled up the cell has to unwrap it

recruit proteins to help join it

together and then they have to go back

and reset the structures and that

resetting of the epigenome happens about

99% that 1% is the aging process

so overtime histones are not returned to

the right places and DNA methylation is

added in places where it shouldn't be we

can read that methylation pattern and I

could tell you how old you are exactly

and when you're even gonna die how could

you tell that well the it's a clock we

call it the Horvath clock named after my

good friend Steve Horvath and so these

little chemicals that accumulate on the

DNA like plaque on the teeth we can read

that and the more you have the older you

are biologically so you might only be 40

you're younger than 40 of course you you

know I'm 50 now but I might be

biologically 60 actually I was and I

changed my life and then the test said I

was biologically 31 I mean one of the

things I found really interesting was

you found a way to make mice age faster

so how'd you do that

well the clock of aging is due to the

loss of the information in the cell and

one way to accelerate that is to go

break a chromosome instead of going in

the Sun we engineered a mouse where we

could break its chromosomes not enough

to cause mutations the cells put the DNA

back together so we didn't lose any

genetic information but if we're right

about the epigenetic information theory

of aging those mice should get old and

that's exactly what happened that's gray

it's got a hunchback it's got dementia

all its organs look old but the real

test was what if we measured that DNA

clock the what we call the DNA

methylation clock and we measured it and

those mice were actually 50% older than

mice that we didn't treat so that isn't

just a mouse that looks old

that Mouse literally is older what's

interesting about this hypothesis is

that if it's true if the noise

accumulating the epigenome is really

what's causing aging well then there are

steps we can take right now to slow the

rate of Aging in our bodies by trying to

better maintain our epigenomes so how do

we do that there's this theory that

billions of years ago early bacteria

took an important evolutionary step they

actually developed two different modes

of living when times were good

they used their energy to grow and

reproduce but when conditions were tough

they used their energy to protect and

repair their cells they evolved what

professor Sinclair calls longevity genes

these genes triggered by adversity

create enzymes which among other things

maintain the epigenome and today those

same longevity genes can be found in

bacteria and us we have these or metic

response genes or longevity genes that

are in all of our cells and they sense

when we've run a lot we've lost our

breath or we're hungry we were a little

bit hot but a little bit cold that these

genes are turning on our general

defenses against aging so what is that

so parts of our cells fall apart they

can put them back together

proteins miss fold they can get rid of

them or put them back together the ends

of the chromosomes get shorter they can

lengthen them a lot of processes that go

on but one of the most important I think

is maintaining the information the

epigenetic information in a cell so that

our cells don't forget what to do

there are three types of longevity gene

they're the ones we work on called

sirtuins and they control the

information in the cell in fact sir in

the sirtuin stands for silent

information regulator number two there

are other ones the other group is called

EMP kinase or AMPK this group of genes

senses how much energy were we're taking

in for mostly in the form of sugar and

then the third group is called mTOR and

these genes control and respond to how

much amino acids were taking in so if

you eat a giant steak you've got a lot

of amino acids coming into your body

that'll actually prevent mTOR from

hunkering down and keeping you being

longer lived so the mouse experiments

actually bear this out the best way to

make a mouse live longer is to reduce

the amount of time it eats so periodic

fasting intermittent fasting to keep it

a little bit cool and to restrict its

amino acids that's the recipe for long

life for a mouse and it's true for

monkeys as well they've been calorie

restricted studies where these monkeys

for 15 years didn't eat as much food as

the ones that gorged themselves whenever

they wanted and they were protected

they didn't just age slower they didn't

get as much died

and heart disease they're actually fit

and healthy when the control group

eating whatever they wanted aged and

became sick quicker when some people

think about eating less like calorie

restriction as a way to extend their

life that doesn't seem like a very

pleasant way to extend life I mean to be

hungry for longer so are there other

ways to you know mimic that effect or to

simulate that there are these molecules

that turn on the sirtuin pathway and

trick the body and so for example in the

lab if I give some of our mice a

molecule called nmn which raises the

level of a chemical called nad you get

hyperactive defenses in the body and

what did you see in these you know

senescent mice that you gave in a mentor

well we had a bit of an incident these

mice that we gave nmn to ran 50% further

but actually some of them ran so far

that the Machine the little treadmill

stopped working and we had to reprogram

the software because this program had

never seen a mouse that ran more than

three kilometres three kilometers for a

mouse for an old Mouse they outran the

young mice and that's like an

ultramarathon for us that would be

probably like taking a 70 year old and

making them run faster than a 20 year

old further yes so these are ultra

marathoners and if we did that to humans

imagine you could have 90 year olds

winning Olympic medals so to sum up

there are six things that you can do

right now to slow the rate of your aging

starting with zero avoid DNA damage wear

sunscreen avoid x-rays and all that sort

of stuff

number one eat less caloric restriction

number two eat less protein because your

body has ways of detecting how much of

that you're taking in number three do

some exercise high-intensity interval

training get your heart rate up to 85%

make your body feel like you're running

from a lion or something number four be

uncomfortably cold or number five be

uncomfortably hot all of these things

will trigger your body's longevity genes

into maintaining your epigenome going in

to repair and protect mode rather

then grow and reproduce if you think

about those things those are generally

all the things that we don't do

but what if slowing aging isn't enough

for you well this is where my interview

with professor Sinclair took an

interesting turn because he's actually

done some research on reversing aging so

how would you do that well effectively

you would need to take the epigenome and

reset it back to an earlier time but how

is that possible back in 2012 a

scientist named Yamanaka received the

Nobel Prize for discovering four factors

which when applied in a gene therapy to

an adult cell would reset the whole

epigenome back to how that cell was when

it was an embryo so it is what is called

a pluripotent stem cell now you wouldn't

want to apply that to your entire body

because well then you would turn into a

giant tumor because your cells wouldn't

know how to differentiate but it does

suggest that there are ways of resetting

your epigenome and they could be the key

to reversing aging the big breakthrough

that we just had in my lab finally you

know about a year or so ago was to

reprogram the eye of a mouse and the eye

we chose the eye because that's a very

hard thing to fix right if you go blind

when you're older we think that's a

one-way thing you're never going to

recover your vision but we decided let's

try it anyway let's let's go for broke

so we put a gene therapy in the eye of

old mice turn their retinas to be young

again reversed Aging in their retinas

so those one-year old mice went back to

about two months and guess what those

mice could see again just like they were

young and again how do you reset one of

these eye cells without resetting it to

just a stem cell well we have to be very

careful not to reset these cells to be

basically a stem cell otherwise we

wouldn't have mice they can see we'd

have mice with a giant tumor in the back

of their eyes so what we do is a couple

of things we didn't use all of the for

reprogramming factors that won the Nobel

Prize we use just three we leave off one

called Mik which causes cancer and those

three seem to be just the right recipe

for taking the age of

the I backwoods but not too far then the

second thing we do is we turn it off we

can actually turn this system on when we

want and off again so that we don't take

them too far back in age can you do that

with any cell we think we can do this in

any tissue where we've now given it to

the whole mouse and those mice are fine

no evidence of cancer they seem to be

really quite healthy so the big question

is can you take a mouse way back the

whole body and be totally young in maybe

back from two years back to two months

and that's what we're doing right now

that's pretty exciting it's freakishly

exciting actually I thought we just slow

down aging now we're talking about an

aging reset you know what we've only

reset the age of the eye once how many

times can we do this maybe it's twice

maybe it's a hundred times so professor

Sinclair claims that his gene therapy

reversed Aging in the mouse's eye and

allowed it to see again but applying a

gene therapy to every one of your

trillion cells is pretty impossible so

in order for this to actually work and

reset an entire body you would need

another way and this is where the

jellyfish come in because moon jellyfish

any cell in an adult jellyfish can

actually be reset into an earlier stage

of its life cycle it can become a polyp

again so it seems like the jellyfish are

actually capable of activating something

like the Yamanaka factors and resetting

their epigenomes to an earlier time in

their lives if we're able to figure out

how they do that well then maybe we

could do the same with our own cells we

do have the ability to reset our

epigenomes but that is typically only

used when we're in the embryonic stage

when we need to maintain all our cells

as stem cells as we age most mammals

including humans we lose stem cells over

time and the stem cells we do have

become more and more restricted over

time into the types of cells they can

make so if we can understand how the

moon jellyfish can take presumably many

different kinds of cells

and reverse-engineer them into the cells

that needs during regeneration that

might give us an idea how to do it in

ourselves as well so I still think were

a fair ways off from reversing aging in

the entire human body but what I found

interesting from talking to professor

Sinclair was that there's at least a

roadmap at least a path ahead where you

can see that it could be possible to

slow and even reverse aging
