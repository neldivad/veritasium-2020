[Music]

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,720
there's a place in the new mexico desert

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,320
open to the public for just two days out

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,200
of the year

8
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,440
but i got to visit by myself with only a

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,920
small film crew

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,279
this is the trinity bomb test site

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,199
where on july 16th 1945 at exactly 5

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,920
29 and 45 seconds in the morning the

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,480
first

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,599
nuclear bomb was exploded

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,559
the test was called trinity there was

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,559
actually a tower here that stood

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,070
100 feet or about 30 meters

18
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,120
[Music]

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,879
the list of people who witnessed the

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,280
test reads like a who's who of 20th

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,640
century physics

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,079
fermi feynman oppenheimer von neumann

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,879
but the test was top secret the general

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,399
public weren't to know

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,600
but how do you hide a huge nuclear

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,480
explosion

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,559
well the albuquerque tribune published a

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,319
statement claiming it was a large but

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,200
accidental conventional explosion it

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,040
wasn't just the general public who were

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,920
kept in the dark

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
the governor of new mexico was not even

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,760
aware that trinity was a nuclear test

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,400
until

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,200
after the bombing of hiroshima even then

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,759
details about the blast were scarce

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,479
but kodak the film company based on the

38
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,159
other side of the country in new york

39
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:24,880
state

40
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,520
well they figured out what was happening

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,840
it all started with some defective x-ray

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,720
film

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,640
kodak found when they developed unused

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,320
film it showed tens or even

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,720
a hundred little dark spots the film had

46
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,880
been exposed to radiation even though it

47
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,400
had never been taken out of its

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,520
packaging

49
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,159
this was actually not a new problem

50
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,119
during world war

51
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,360
ii radium was used extensively to make

52
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,960
glow-in-the-dark dials flight

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,920
instruments and

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,960
watches radium glows because it is

55
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,680
radioactive it gives off alpha particles

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,360
now some of this radium ended up on

57
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,600
paper and cardboard at these factories

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,360
and because supplies were scarce

59
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,880
leftover paper products were

60
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,040
salvaged and recycled leading small

61
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,079
amounts of radium to

62
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,560
end up in the general paper supply and

63
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
when this paper was used to package up

64
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,680
kodak film

65
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,840
radiation from radium would expose the

66
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,080
film before it was ever used

67
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,160
and it was such a problem that kodak

68
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,080
altered their supply chain carefully

69
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,720
selecting

70
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,400
just a few paper mills where they could

71
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,800
strictly control the raw materials

72
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,480
one of the mills was in vincennes

73
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,319
indiana on the wabash river

74
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,160
it made strawboard which was inserted

75
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,400
between sheets of x-ray film

76
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,080
now for months this strawboard was

77
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
working perfectly until a batch

78
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,120
manufactured on august 6 1945 started to

79
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,680
cause spots to appear on the x-ray film

80
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,000
so julian webb a scientist at kodak was

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
tasked with solving the problem

82
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,519
so he punched out little holes of

83
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,200
strawboard behind where the film had

84
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,319
been exposed

85
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,319
and then he measured the alpha particles

86
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,920
coming off that material

87
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,400
but the level was not appreciably higher

88
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,440
than background

89
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,760
and this ruled out radium and the other

90
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,000
naturally occurring isotopes of uranium

91
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,519
thorium and actinium

92
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,760
all alpha emitters but when he measured

93
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,720
beta radiation

94
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,640
he found significant activity this

95
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,400
matched what he saw on the film

96
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,879
the radiation penetrated several layers

97
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,319
something beta particles can do

98
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,879
but not alpha and over a period of

99
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,360
months

100
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,800
he measured the half-life of the

101
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,640
radioactive substance finding it was

102
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
only about 30 days

103
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,319
this half-life combined with the energy

104
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,000
of the beta particles led webb to

105
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,280
conclude that the radioactive

106
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,040
contaminant was most likely

107
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,159
cerium 141 an isotope that could

108
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,640
only have come from a nuclear fission

109
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,280
explosion

110
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,799
what's more the same contaminant

111
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,239
appeared in paper from another of

112
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,280
kodak's mills

113
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,280
this one hundreds of kilometers away in

114
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,959
tama iowa

115
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,519
so how did cerium 141 end up in that

116
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,640
straw board

117
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,400
well when that first atomic bomb

118
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,319
exploded in the new mexico desert

119
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,640
the plutonium core underwent a fission

120
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,840
chain reaction

121
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,560
plutonium nuclei ripped in two releasing

122
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,560
energy and more neutrons to continue the

123
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,840
chain reaction

124
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,560
but vision is a messy process it doesn't

125
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,159
always split the nucleus into the same

126
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:08,959
products

127
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,680
instead hundreds of different nuclei are

128
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,560
produced

129
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,200
virtually all of them radioactive and

130
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,320
they are carried up into the

131
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,079
stratosphere with the mushroom cloud

132
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,918
and dispersed on air currents whichever

133
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,600
way the wind blows

134
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,360
in this case they traveled over a

135
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,199
thousand kilometers ending up over

136
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,720
iowa and indiana here rain captured some

137
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,479
of these radioactive particles causing

138
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,360
them to fall

139
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,680
out of the sky hence the term

140
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,280
radioactive fallout

141
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,360
this radioactive material ended up in

142
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,040
rivers like the ones that run beside the

143
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,400
two kodak paper mills

144
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,240
which used that river water to make

145
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,040
their paper so that's how cerium 141

146
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,360
ended up fogging kodak's x-ray film

147
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,240
and exposing the u.s nuclear secret now

148
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,000
word of kodak's detection made it back

149
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,759
to scientists at los alamos

150
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,520
who were intrigued and wanted to know

151
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,759
more a consultant wrote to webb to find

152
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,600
out how much radioactivity per square

153
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,800
mile he detected

154
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,199
and the size of the particles which fell

155
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,840
and the half-life of the activity

156
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,759
although webb completed his experiments

157
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,520
by the end of 1945

158
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,960
he only published them in physical

159
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,800
review in 1949

160
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,840
and that's because i'm sure he

161
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,759
recognized just how sensitive his

162
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,039
findings were

163
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,759
after all he himself had worked on the

164
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,360
manhattan project at berkeley

165
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,120
and oak ridge using electromagnetic

166
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,000
techniques to separate uranium isotopes

167
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,759
what was clear to kodak was that they

168
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,600
needed to take steps to protect their

169
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,400
film

170
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,560
and so they installed air samplers to

171
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,400
monitor for fallout in the air intakes

172
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,479
of their buildings

173
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,800
fallout is a vitally important subject

174
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,280
bombs are being tested which to some

175
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,080
extent

176
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,360
contaminate the atmosphere now the us

177
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,039
government was aware they needed to

178
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,960
carefully consider where to test nuclear

179
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,759
bombs

180
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,919
what we need is a site closer to our

181
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,240
stateside laboratories and available air

182
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,039
support

183
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,960
somewhere in the continental united

184
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,120
states but where

185
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
after trinity the manhattan project's

186
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,039
chief of radiological safety stafford

187
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:07,600
warren

188
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
recommended tests be conducted at least

189
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,039
150 miles

190
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,319
from civilian populations in 1948 an air

191
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,319
force meteorologist colonel holzman

192
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,080
told the site selection committee that a

193
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,479
location on the east coast would be best

194
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,919
because otherwise the prevailing

195
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,000
westerly winds across the u.s would

196
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,240
spread the fallout across the country

197
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,360
the site they chose was nevada almost as

198
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,039
far west as you can go and just 100

199
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,800
miles from las vegas

200
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,199
the rationale was this site was closer

201
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,120
to weapons labs so it would accelerate

202
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,560
their development

203
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,960
after the first bomb test there in 1951

204
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,560
kodak detected fallout at their

205
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,720
headquarters in rochester new york

206
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,800
after a snowstorm geiger counters read

207
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,360
25 times the normal background

208
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,599
so kodak threatened to sue the us

209
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,720
government for the

210
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,479
considerable amount of damage to our

211
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,319
products resulting from the nevada tests

212
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,520
or from any further

213
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,319
atomic energy tests but instead of a

214
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,039
lawsuit

215
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,280
the two sides came to an agreement the

216
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,960
atomic energy commission would give

217
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,520
kodak

218
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,759
and indeed the entire photographic

219
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,160
industry advanced warning about upcoming

220
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,840
tests and where the fallout was likely

221
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,800
to end up given

222
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,680
meteorological models in return the

223
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,520
company agreed to keep quiet about

224
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,840
radioactive fallout

225
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,319
and from 1951 until 1963 the u.s

226
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,599
conducted a hundred

227
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,759
above-ground nuclear tests in nevada the

228
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,680
resulting mixture of radioactive nuclei

229
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,400
was blown

230
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,160
as predicted across most of the country

231
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,400
when these atoms fell on agricultural

232
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,639
land they were eaten by livestock or

233
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,720
taken up in crops and they became part

234
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,080
of the food supply

235
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,280
radioactive iodine 131 eaten by cows is

236
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,120
passed on to humans through their milk

237
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,960
and this is particularly problematic

238
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,879
because iodine is concentrated by the

239
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,800
body in the thyroid gland

240
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
and children with small developing

241
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,919
thyroids

242
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,319
drink the most milk it's estimated that

243
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,240
the nuclear tests led to tens of

244
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,840
thousands of extra cases

245
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,400
of thyroid cancer the atomic energy

246
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,919
commission wasn't too worried about

247
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,199
iodine 131

248
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,800
because it has a radioactive half-life

249
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,280
of only eight days it decays quickly

250
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,680
they were more concerned about

251
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,720
strontium-90 which has a half-life of

252
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
almost 30 years

253
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,639
strontium-90 because of a unique

254
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,479
combination of properties

255
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,199
probably represents the greatest danger

256
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,520
strontium-90 behaves biochemically like

257
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,319
calcium

258
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,560
so when ingested it ends up in our teeth

259
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,440
and bones

260
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,599
and as it emits ionizing beta radiation

261
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,120
it can cause bone cancer

262
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,279
cancer in the surrounding tissues or

263
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
leukemia

264
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,559
in what's become known as the baby tooth

265
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,000
survey scientists in st

266
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,039
louis collected up 320 000 teeth between

267
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,640
1950 and 1970.

268
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,600
they found that kids born in 1963 had 50

269
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,279
times more strontium in their baby teeth

270
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,360
than those born in 1950.

271
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,440
presently existing evidence indicates

272
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,560
that fallout

273
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,880
has caused only a small increase in

274
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,560
background radiation

275
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,279
and correspondingly only a minute

276
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,240
increase

277
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,240
in mutations in reality both iodine 131

278
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,760
and strontium 90 plus

279
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,440
other radioactive isotopes in the

280
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,880
fallout almost certainly

281
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
increased rates of cancer and other

282
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,720
diseases in the u.s population

283
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,480
this is borne out by studies showing

284
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,240
correlations between rates of disease

285
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,560
and

286
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,959
radioactive isotope uptake the graph

287
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,200
shows a peak in 1964 just after the

288
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,000
partial nuclear

289
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,120
test ban treaty was signed in 1963 it

290
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,120
banned nuclear tests in the atmosphere

291
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,360
underwater and in outer space leaving

292
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,279
only underground tests

293
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,040
a central aim of the treaty was to

294
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,880
address growing public concern

295
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,959
over the scale of nuclear tests and the

296
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,800
resulting radioactive fallout

297
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,480
when the u.s senate finally held a

298
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,240
hearing on the matter almost 50 years

299
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,760
later in 1997

300
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,360
the agreement with kodak was sharply

301
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,800
criticized especially by

302
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,959
senator tom harkin who said the

303
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,480
government warned the entire

304
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
photographic industry and provided maps

305
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,279
and forecasts of potential contamination

306
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,440
where i asked were the maps for dairy

307
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,200
farmers where were the warnings to

308
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,839
parents of children in these areas

309
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,839
the government protected rolls of film

310
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,760
but not the lives of our kids

311
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,959
there's something wrong with this

312
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,279
picture and i think the main problem was

313
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,720
that in the 40s and 50s

314
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,920
not enough was known about the

315
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,600
biological effects of radioactive

316
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,640
fallout

317
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,560
every so often a gene changes or mutates

318
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,640
and a characteristic of the organism is

319
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,839
altered

320
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,720
we do not know the exact process by

321
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,640
which mutations occur

322
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,120
cancers took years or even decades to

323
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,920
appear

324
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,760
and fallout models predicted a more

325
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,839
uniform and therefore less concentrated

326
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:34,480
spread

327
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,800
of contaminants when students in albany

328
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
new york measured a thousand times

329
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,160
background levels after a heavy

330
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,040
rainstorm

331
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,959
well the atomic energy commission's

332
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,640
report about the event called it

333
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,120
an interesting example of a small area

334
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,200
of very intense fallout

335
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,959
now concerned with alarming people

336
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,040
unnecessarily in downwind communities

337
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,800
the atomic energy commission's approach

338
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,600
was to

339
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,120
limit as much as possible the

340
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,880
information that was shared

341
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,279
their conclusion it seems was that

342
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,760
people are less sensitive to radiation

343
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,640
than film is so the studies of

344
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,959
radioactive fallout remain

345
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,079
inconclusive what is certain is that

346
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,000
1945 marked the start of a new

347
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,560
era no radioactive fallout before then

348
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,680
and lots after it

349
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,120
and scientists have shown you can use

350
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,440
this to detect wine forgeries

351
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,360
any wine made in the last 75 years will

352
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,160
give off distinctive gamma rays from

353
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,399
cesium-137

354
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,519
whereas none before that date will plus

355
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,200
the level of activity can be used to

356
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,880
estimate the vintage at least between

357
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,160
1952 and

358
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,640
1980 a similar technique can be used to

359
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,399
detect art forgeries because

360
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,880
old paint contains no radioactive cesium

361
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,000
or strontium

362
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
you can even use strontium 90 to

363
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,920
determine the age of a skeleton

364
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,079
how long ago that person died given it's

365
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,240
in the past 75 years or so

366
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,920
this technique has been employed in

367
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
dozens of forensic cases

368
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,839
where there previously was no reliable

369
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,600
method of estimating the year of death

370
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,920
if it was within the last 50 years

371
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,680
this method works because while we're

372
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,480
alive we are ingesting strontium-90

373
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,440
something that stops when we die to this

374
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,760
day

375
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,839
we all have some strontium-90 in our

376
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,320
bones albeit at lower levels

377
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,000
it's been about two half-lives since the

378
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,920
peak of radioactive contamination so

379
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,519
three quarters of it have decayed

380
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,279
and the rest has dispersed throughout

381
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,880
the environment so

382
