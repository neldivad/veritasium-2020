1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,449
most New Year's resolutions fail so in

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:04,770
this video I want to talk about the

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,140
science of why they fail and how to

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,030
avoid that so your New Year's

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,130
resolutions actually succeed and I want

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,500
to tell you about three of my New Year's

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,190
resolutions for 2020 the first one is to

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,590
stop going to news websites I find I

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,949
kill a ton of time by doing that now

10
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,480
don't get me wrong I do think it's

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,010
important to know what's going on in the

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,900
world but I just don't think following

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,550
the day-to-day developments of the news

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,488
cycle is the way to do that so instead I

15
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,059
am going to get one newspaper delivered

16
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,510
to my house every week and that is how I

17
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,590
am gonna stay informed

18
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,120
research has shown it is more effective

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,770
to make resolutions at new years than at

20
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,260
any other time of the year in fact one

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,520
study found that people who made

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,309
resolutions on January 1st were 10 times

23
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,649
as likely to stick with them 6 months

24
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,120
later than people who made their

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,800
resolutions at other times of the year

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,829
in January 1st 2020 is the first day of

27
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,589
a new decade so it may be even better

28
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,380
side note and those of you who want to

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,180
argue that the first day of the decade

30
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,939
is actually January 1st 2021 while you

31
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,500
may technically be correct because there

32
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,630
was no year 0 we went straight from 1 BC

33
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,439
to 180 for all intents and purposes

34
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:21,450
psychologically this January 1st is the

35
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,630
first day of the 2020s and that is what

36
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,049
matters

37
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,970
so the technicalities I think are

38
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,979
unimportant in this argument should be

39
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,939
put to bed the 2020s start on Jan 1 but

40
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,520
now the bad news even a resolution made

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,530
at New Year's will most likely fail

42
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,990
which is why gyms are packed in January

43
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,939
but they start to clear out by March

44
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,520
what research has found that only around

45
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,100
8% of people can stick with their

46
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,320
resolutions through the end of the year

47
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,520
so why is this and how do we avoid that

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,610
trap I think it all starts with a

49
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,149
misconception

50
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,800
Oh No

51
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:09,550
Oh No boo get well this is gonna be the

52
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,539
part of the video where I ran on the

53
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,650
treadmill with the treadmills just

54
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,640
broken so I think the misconception is

55
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,830
that people think that in order to make

56
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,410
big changes in their lives that they

57
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,690
have to make some sort of really big

58
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,120
effort I mean let's say your goal was to

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,910
run a marathon you might plan on running

60
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,170
ten kilometers

61
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,750
three times a week that seems kind of

62
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,730
proportionate to the end goal and you

63
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,130
might be excited and really motivated to

64
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,410
do it for the first few weeks but at

65
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,770
some point that motivation is gonna lag

66
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,410
and running 10k is gonna seem too hard

67
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,910
and so you're gonna sort of fall back

68
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,400
into old habits the misconception is

69
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,590
thinking you need to go big and so being

70
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,480
over ambitious with your goals and then

71
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,520
not being able to commit and stick to

72
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,270
them I'm gonna fix this the truth is

73
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,980
you're much better off if you pick small

74
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,050
targets that you can hit consistently

75
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,900
that's the idea behind James clears book

76
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,110
atomic habits which is this idea that if

77
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,900
you can get just 1% better every day at

78
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,720
something it will take a minimum amount

79
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,350
of effort but over time the effects will

80
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,130
compound just like compound interest and

81
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,750
James Clare proposes the two-minute rule

82
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,370
pick something that you can do in just

83
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,500
two minutes so if you want to run a

84
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,930
marathon start by say running two

85
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,880
minutes a day that is something that you

86
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,800
can't say you don't have time for and

87
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,470
once that habit sticks well then you can

88
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,360
try to extend it into something more

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,150
ambitious the next problem with

90
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,670
resolutions is they are too often vague

91
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,860
the most common resolutions that people

92
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,680
make are to lose weight exercise more

93
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,470
and to eat better the problem is those

94
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,540
things are so nondescript that it's hard

95
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,459
to know if you're making progress and

96
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:57,040
it's really easy to regress into your

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,290
old habits so the science around this

98
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,830
says you need to be specific and write

99
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,380
down your goals people who write down

100
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,810
their goals are 40% more likely to

101
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,329
achieve them that is pretty significant

102
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:12,500
just by taking that step of

103
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,750
putting pen to paper and I'm thinking

104
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,670
here in this video you should put your

105
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,320
New Year's resolutions in the comments

106
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,420
because at least that is taking a step

107
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,550
towards committing yourself to a goal

108
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:27,650
for the year my second new year's

109
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,560
resolution for 2020 is to write in a

110
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,950
daily planner every day of this year in

111
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,320
fact I can be more specific than that

112
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,210
I will write one word in this book each

113
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,740
day now I know one word might seem

114
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,770
unhelpfully ridiculously little to write

115
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,690
in this book but I want to commit to

116
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,660
this idea of starting small with the

117
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,130
idea that if I get in the habit of

118
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,740
making the time to at least write down

119
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,070
one word on each one of these pages well

120
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,750
then maybe some days I will write more

121
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,340
than one word and that will be helpful

122
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,680
in terms of planning my day a little bit

123
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,540
and so hopefully I will be more

124
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,070
productive than I would have been

125
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,140
otherwise and then it's really important

126
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,450
to track your progress in an obvious and

127
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,550
visual way and I'm going to use the

128
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:27,800
everyday calendar by Simone yet oddly

129
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,830
satisfying where there's a button for

130
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,290
every day of the year and you can push

131
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,080
it and the light turns on and that is

132
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,510
really satisfying so I think this will

133
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,300
encourage me to write down a word early

134
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,540
in the day so that I can go and turn on

135
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,360
the light for that day what's great

136
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,700
about this is it's a very visual way to

137
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,250
track my progress and to have it in an

138
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,960
obvious place where I can look at it all

139
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,940
the time and I'll put it in the back of

140
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,220
shot for some of my videos in 2020 so

141
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,530
you guys can see how I'm progressing

142
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,110
towards this goal so the third major

143
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,180
problem with New Year's resolutions is

144
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,740
that people seem to think it's about

145
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,050
having more willpower or motivation

146
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,650
being able to resist temptation better

147
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,169
but willpower is a finite resource and

148
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:17,270
it can be depleted that there are gonna

149
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,850
be some bad days and that is when you're

150
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,360
gonna relapse so relying on willpower is

151
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,520
not an effective strategy and research

152
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,560
has shown that people who have better

153
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,169
self-control actually just have to

154
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:31,900
exercise it less the way they're able to

155
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,669
do that is by structuring their

156
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:35,620
environments so they don't have to

157
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,979
exercise their willpower I find in my

158
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:41,229
kitchen it's always like the treats and

159
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:43,650
snacks which are left out on the counter

160
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,539
but the veggies which are like tucked

161
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,629
away in the vegetable crisper drawer and

162
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:52,030
I get it because you know that's where

163
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,560
the veggies are meant to go to keep them

164
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,539
crisp but the problem is if I don't see

165
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:56,710
them if they're not in my line of sight

166
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,870
I will just end up eating what's on the

167
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,150
counter and not going digging for

168
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,409
veggies so we need a way of changing our

169
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:07,719
environments so that we make better

170
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,689
choices which brings me to my third and

171
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:13,090
final new year's resolution for 2020 I

172
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,719
am deleting social media apps off of my

173
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:18,490
phone I'm getting rid of Instagram and

174
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,439
Twitter you are watching the exact

175
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,900
moment that I do that

176
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,029
the reason for this is I find I just

177
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:27,279
kill way too much time going into these

178
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,979
apps and research shows that any tiny

179
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:31,810
distraction that you have during your

180
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,599
day takes you you know something like

181
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:37,000
20-25 minutes to get back into your work

182
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,330
and so I'm losing a lot of time to just

183
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,430
procrastinating with these apps so I'm

184
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,690
getting rid of them off my phone so I

185
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,699
don't have to use my willpower to not

186
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,529
click them mindlessly as I normally

187
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:49,900
would and I've actually downloaded an

188
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,349
app that will block news sites and block

189
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:55,779
my social media while I'm working

190
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:58,330
because that way I don't have to

191
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,849
restrain myself the systems that I put

192
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:03,219
in place will restrain me for me I know

193
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:05,289
a lot of this sounds a little bit CGP

194
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:07,449
grey but I think he's onto something you

195
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,039
don't need to follow the day-to-day

196
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,050
movements of the news cycle and you do

197
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,490
not need to be scrolling social media

198
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,080
all the time particularly when you're

199
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,120
trying to get useful work done so that's

200
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,870
how I feel

201
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,169
I want to optimize my 2020 by locking

202
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:23,050
down all my potential distractions not

203
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,599
needing any willpower and I've got some

204
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,219

205
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:33,490
