1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,899
what's the connection between a dripping

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,109
faucet the Mandelbrot set a population

3
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:09,480
of rabbits thermal convection in a fluid

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,809
and the firing of neurons in your brain

5
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:17,369
it's this one simple equation this video

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,990
answer my question at the end of this

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,390
video so stay tuned for that let's say

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,399
you want to model a population of

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,399
rabbits if you have X rabbits this year

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,440
how many rabbits will you have next year

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,840
well the simplest model I can imagine is

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,399
where we just multiplied by some number

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,190
the growth rate R which could be say 2

17
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,530
and this would mean the population would

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,050
double every year and the problem with

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,910
that is it means the number of rabbits

20
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,649
would grow exponentially forever

21
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,129
so I can add the term 1 minus X to

22
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:57,600
represent the constraints of the

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,239
environment and here I'm imagining the

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,460
population X is a percentage of the

25
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,040
theoretical maximum so it goes from 0 to

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,010
1 and as it approaches that maximum then

27
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,490
this term goes to 0 and that constrains

28
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,020
the population so this is the logistic

29
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,960
map xn plus 1 is the population next

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,630
year and xn is the population this year

31
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,060
and if you graph the population next

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,299
year versus the population this year you

33
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,630
see it is just an inverted parabola it's

34
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,220
the simplest equation you can make that

35
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,439
has a negative feedback loop the bigger

36
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,329
the population gets over here the

37
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,850
smaller it'll be the following year so

38
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,750
let's try an example let's say we're

39
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,850
dealing with a particularly active group

40
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,479
of rabbits so R equals two point six and

41
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,970
then let's pick a starting population of

42
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,540
40% of the maximum so point four and

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:01,049
then times 1 minus 0.4 and we get 0.62

44
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,600
four okay so the population increased in

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,189
the first year but what we're really

46
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,560
interested in is the long term behavior

47
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,690
of this population so we can put this

48
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,270
population back into the equation and to

49
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,100
speed things up you can actually type

50
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,140
two point six times answer times one -

51
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,260
answer get point six one so the

52
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,390
population dropped a little hit it again

53
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,720
point six one nine point six one three

54
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,360
point six one seven point six one five

55
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,450
point six one six point six one five and

56
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,670
if I keep hitting Enter here you see

57
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,290
that the population doesn't really

58
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,930
change it has stabilized which matches

59
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,060
what we see in the wild populations

60
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,860
often remain the same as long as births

61
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,380
and deaths are balanced now I want to

62
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,170
make a graph of this iteration you can

63
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,640
see here that it's reached an

64
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,830
equilibrium value of point six one five

65
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,410
now what would happen if I change the

66
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,630
initial population I'm just going to

67
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,720
move this slider here and what you see

68
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,380
is the first few years change but the

69
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,610
equilibrium population remains the same

70
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,070
so we can basically ignore the initial

71
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,380
population so what I'm really interested

72
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,750
in is how does this equilibrium

73
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,290
population vary depending on are the

74
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,050
growth rate so as you can see if I lower

75
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,510
the growth rate the equilibrium

76
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,390
population decreases that makes sense

77
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,380
and in fact if R goes below one well

78
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,500
then the population drops and eventually

79
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,410
goes extinct so what I want to do is

80
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,070
make another graph where on the x axis I

81
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,940
have R the growth rate and on the y axis

82
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,730
I'm plotting the equilibrium population

83
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,010
the population you get after many many

84
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,830
many generations okay for low values of

85
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,810
R we see the populations always go

86
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,150
extinct so the equilibrium value is zero

87
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,580
but once our hits 1 the population

88
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,400
stabilizes on to a constant value and

89
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,380
the higher R is the higher the

90
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,129
equilibrium population

91
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:11,249
so far so good but now comes the weird

92
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:11,579
part

93
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:15,480
once our passes three the graph splits

94
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,100
in two why what's happening well no

95
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,660
matter how many times you iterate the

96
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,900
equation it never settles on to a single

97
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,570
constant value instead it oscillates

98
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,479
back and forth between two values one

99
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,979
year the population is higher the next

100
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,009
year lower and then the cycle repeats

101
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:36,539
the cyclic nature of populations is

102
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:38,340
observed in nature too one year there

103
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,050
might be more rabbits and then fewer the

104
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,210
next year and more again the year after

105
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,449
as our continues to increase the fork

106
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:48,300
spreads apart and then each one splits

107
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,080
again

108
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,270
now instead of oscillating back and

109
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,000
forth between two values populations go

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,590
through a four year cycle before

111
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,320
repeating since the length of the cycle

112
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,930
or period has doubled these are known as

113
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,020
period doubling bifurcation z' and as R

114
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,449
increases further there are more period

115
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:08,550
doubling bifurcation z' they come faster

116
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,849
and faster leading to cycles of 8 16 32

117
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:15,270
64 and then at R equals three point five

118
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,229
seven chaos the population never settles

119
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:21,720
down at all it bounces around as if at

120
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,330
random in fact this equation provided

121
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,190
one of the first methods of generating

122
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,650
random numbers on computers it was a way

123
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,990
to get something unpredictable from a

124
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,539
deterministic machine there is no

125
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,509
pattern here no repeating of course if

126
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,070
you did know the exact initial

127
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,479
conditions you could calculate the

128
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,820
values exactly so they are considered

129
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,520
only pseudo-random numbers now you might

130
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,199
expect the equation to be chaotic from

131
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,650
here on out but as R increases order

132
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,349
returns there are these windows of

133
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:54,770
stable periodic behavior amid the chaos

134
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,630
for example at R equals 3 point 8 3

135
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,909
there is a stable cycle with a period of

136
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:03,090
3 years and as R continues to increase

137
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,680
it splits into 6 12 24 and so on before

138
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,110
returning to chaos in fact this one

139
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,060
equation contains periods of every

140
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,680
length 3750 1052 whatever you like if

141
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,610
you just have the right value

142
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,530
are looking at this bifurcation diagram

143
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,629
you may notice that it looks like a

144
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:28,719
fractal the large-scale features look to

145
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:30,340
be repeated on smaller and smaller

146
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,699
scales and sure enough if you zoom in

147
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:37,289
you see that it is in fact a fractal

148
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:40,060
arguably the most famous fractal is the

149
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,030
Mandelbrot set the plot twist here is

150
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,550
that the bifurcation diagram is actually

151
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,030
part of the Mandelbrot set how does that

152
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,240
work well quick recap on the Mandelbrot

153
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,060
set it is based on this iterated

154
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,909
equation so the way it works is you pick

155
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:00,219
a number C any number in the complex

156
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:04,090
plane and then start with Z equals 0 and

157
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,430
then iterate this equation over and over

158
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,219
again if it blows up to infinity well

159
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:11,319
then the number C is not part of the set

160
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:14,409
but if this number remains finite after

161
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:16,900
unlimited iterations well then it is

162
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,750
part of the Mandelbrot set so let's try

163
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,650
for example C equals 1 so we've got 0

164
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,590
squared plus 1 equals 1 then 1 squared

165
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,009
plus 1 equals 2 2 squared plus 1 equals

166
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:34,029
5 5 squared plus 1 equals 26 so pretty

167
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:36,490
quickly you can see that with C equals 1

168
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,520
this equation is going to blow up so the

169
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,770
number 1 is not part of the Mandelbrot

170
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,159
set what if we try C equals negative 1

171
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,379
well then we've got 0 squared minus 1

172
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:49,870
equals negative 1 negative 1 squared

173
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,629
minus 1 equals 0 and so we're back to 0

174
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:55,180
squared minus 1 equals negative 1 so we

175
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,039
see that this function is going to keep

176
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,449
oscillating back and forth between

177
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:01,449
negative 1 and 0 and so it'll remain

178
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:04,060
finite and so C equals negative 1 is

179
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,569
part of the Mandelbrot set now normally

180
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:09,759
when you see pictures of the Mandelbrot

181
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,159
set it just shows you the boundary

182
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,830
between the numbers that cause this

183
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,719
iterated equation to remain finite and

184
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:20,050
those that cause it to blow up but it

185
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,940
doesn't really show you how these

186
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,150
numbers stay finite so what we've done

187
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,610
here is actually iterated that equation

188
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,849
thousands of times and then plotted on

189
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:31,520
the z

190
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,010
axis the value that that iteration

191
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,029
actually takes so if we look from the

192
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:42,529
side what you'll actually see is the

193
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:47,720
bifurcation diagram it is part of this

194
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,830
Mandelbrot set so what's really going on

195
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,390
here well what this is showing us is

196
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,180
that all of the numbers in the main

197
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,990
cardioid they end up stabilizing on to a

198
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,920
single constant value but the numbers in

199
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,440
this main bulb will they end up

200
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,300
oscillating back and forth between two

201
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,240
values and in this bulb they end up

202
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,550
oscillating between four values they've

203
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,010
got a period of four and then eight and

204
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,310
then 16 32 and so on and then you hit

205
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,890
the chaotic part the chaotic part of the

206
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,709
bifurcation diagram happens out here on

207
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:26,839
what's called the needle of the

208
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:28,279
Mandelbrot set where the Mandelbrot set

209
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,250
gets really thin and you can see this

210
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,740
medallion here that looks like a smaller

211
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,839
version of the entire Mandelbrot set

212
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,060
well that corresponds to the window of

213
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,490
stability in the bifurcation plot with a

214
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,160
period of three now the bifurcation

215
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,950
diagram only exists on the real line

216
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,800
because we only put real numbers into

217
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,190
our equation but all of these bulbs off

218
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,440
of the main cardioid well they also have

219
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,430
periodic cycles of for example 3 or 4 or

220
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,670
5 and so you see these repeated ghostly

221
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,440
images if we look in the z axis

222
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,420
effectively they're oscillating between

223
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,800
these values as well

224
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,800
personally I find this extraordinarily

225
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,530
beautiful but if you're more practically

226
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,630
minded you may be asking but does this

227
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,000
equation actually model populations of

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,750
animals and the answer is yes

229
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,800
particularly in the controlled

230
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,690
environment scientists have set up in

231
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,360
labs what I find even more amazing is

232
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,840
how this one simple equation applies to

233
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,080
a huge range of totally unrelated areas

234
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,090
of science the first major experimental

235
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,740
confirmation came from a fluid

236
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,650
dynamicists named Lib Taber he created a

237
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,500
small rectangular box with mercury

238
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,410
inside and he used a small temperature

239
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,530
gradient to induce convection just two

240
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,260
counter-rotating cylinders of fluid

241
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,660
inside his box that's all the box was

242
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,910
large enough for and of course he

243
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,380
couldn't look in and see what the fluid

244
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,090
was doing so he measured the temperature

245
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,480
using a probe in the top and what he saw

246
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,630
was a regular spike a periodic spike in

247
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,490
the temperature that's like when the

248
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,980
logistic equation converges on a single

249
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,200
value but as he increased the

250
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,480
temperature gradient a wobble developed

251
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,420
on those rolling cylinders at half the

252
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,670
original frequency the spikes in

253
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,110
temperature were no longer the same

254
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,320
height instead they went back and forth

255
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,660
between two different heights he had

256
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,590
achieved period two and as he continued

257
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,150
to increase the temperature

258
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,570
he saw period doubling again now he had

259
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,760
four different temperatures before the

260
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,000
cycle repeated and then eight this was a

261
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,340
pretty spectacular confirmation of the

262
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,880
theory in a beautifully crafted

263
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,860
experiment but this was only the

264
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,520
beginning

265
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,710
scientists have studied the response of

266
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,770
our eyes and salamander eyes to

267
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,260
flickering lights and what they find is

268
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,900
a period doubling that once the light

269
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,810
reaches a certain rate of flickering our

270
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,660
eyes only respond to every other flicker

271
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,810
it's amazing in these papers to see the

272
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,630
bifurcation diagram emerge albeit a bit

273
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,730
fuzzy because it comes from real-world

274
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,540
data

275
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,570
in another study scientists gave rabbits

276
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,910
a drug that sent their hearts into

277
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,720
fibrillation

278
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,340
I guess they felt there were too many

279
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,960
rabbits out there I mean if you don't

280
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,100
know what fibrillation is it's where

281
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,900
your heart beats in an incredibly

282
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,640
irregular way and doesn't really pump

283
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,710
any blood so if you don't fix it you die

284
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,560
but what they found was on the path to

285
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,400
fibrillation

286
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,130
they found the period doubling route to

287
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,560
chaos the rabbits started out with a

288
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,500
periodic beat and then it went into a

289
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,630
two cycle two beats close together and

290
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,420
then a four cycle four different beats

291
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,910
before it repeated again and eventually

292
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,910
a periodic behavior now it was really

293
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,340
cool about this study was they monitored

294
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,070
the heart in real time and used chaos

295
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,990
theory to determine when to apply

296
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,420
electrical shocks to the heart to return

297
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,760
it to periodicity and they were able to

298
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,870
do that successfully

299
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,140
so they used chaos to control a heart

300
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,240
and figure out a smarter way to deliver

301
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,520
electric shocks to set it beating

302
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,250
normally again that's pretty amazing and

303
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,190
then there is the issue of the dripping

304
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,950
faucet most of us of course think of

305
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,990
dripping faucets as very regular

306
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,650
periodic objects but a lot of research

307
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,840
has gone into finding that once the flow

308
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,790
rate increases a little bit you get

309
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,920
period doubling so now the drips come

310
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,350
two at a time to tip to tip and

311
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,780
eventually from a dripping faucet you

312
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,360
can get chaotic behavior just by

313
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,490
adjusting the flow rate and you think

314
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,770
like what really is a faucet well

315
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,110
there's constant pressure water and a

316
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,810
constant size aperture and yet what

317
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,470
you're getting is chaotic dripping so

318
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,810
this is a really easy chaotic system you

319
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,420
can experiment with at home go open a

320
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,640
tap just a little bit and see if you can

321
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,630
get a periodic dripping in your house

322
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,180
the bifurcation diagram pops up in so

323
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,370
many different places that it starts to

324
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,160
feel spooky and I want to tell you

325
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,110
something that'll make it seem even

326
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,829
spookier

327
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:32,230
there was this physicist Mitchell

328
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,019
Feigenbaum who was looking at when the

329
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:38,110
bifurcations occur he divided the width

330
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,690
of each bifurcation section by the next

331
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,230
one and he found that ratio closed in on

332
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,170
this number four point six six nine

333
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,149
which is now called the Feigenbaum

334
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:52,389
constant the bifurcations come faster

335
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:54,819
and faster but in a ratio that

336
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:59,019
approaches this fixed value and no one

337
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:00,910
knows where this constant comes from it

338
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,100
doesn't seem to relate to any other

339
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,730
known physical constant so it is itself

340
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,000
a fundamental constant of nature what's

341
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,850
even crazier is that it doesn't have to

342
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,790
be the particular form of the equation I

343
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,660
showed you earlier

344
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,050
any equation that has a single hump if

345
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,300
you iterate it the way that we have so

346
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,149
you could use xn plus 1 equals sine X

347
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:28,329
for example if you iterate that one

348
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:29,949
again and again and again you will also

349
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:33,399
see bifurcations not only that but the

350
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,250
ratio of when those bifurcations occur

351
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,180
will have the same scaling for point six

352
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,130
six nine any single hump function

353
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,949
iterated will give you that fundamental

354
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:51,939
constant so why is this well it's

355
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:55,509
referred to as universality because

356
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:58,000
there seems to be something fundamental

357
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,880
and very Universal about this process

358
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,120
this type of equation and that constant

359
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,930
value in 1976 the biologist Robert May

360
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,839
wrote a paper in nature about this very

361
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:11,589
equation

362
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:14,019
it's sparked a revolution and people

363
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:15,670
looking into this stuff I mean that

364
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,279
papers been cited thousands of times and

365
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:20,920
in the paper he makes this plea that we

366
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,100
should teach students about this simple

367
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,860
equation because it gives you a new

368
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,829
intuition for ways in which simple

369
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:31,580
things simple equations

370
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,070
can create very complex behaviors and I

371
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:39,080
still think that today we don't really

372
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,890
teach this way I mean we teach simple

373
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,780
equations and simple outcomes because

374
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,820
those are the easy things to do and

375
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,200
those are the things that make sense

376
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,140
we're not gonna throw chaos at students

377
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,450
but maybe we should maybe we should

378
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,340
throw at least a little bit which is why

379
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,890
I've been so excited about chaos and I

380
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,320
am so excited about this equation

381
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,110
because you know how did I get to be 37

382
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,760
years old without hearing of the

383
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,510
Feigenbaum constant ever since I read

384
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,329
James Gleeks book chaos I have wanted to

385
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,970
make videos on this topic and now I'm

386
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,380
finally getting around to it and

387
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,660
hopefully I'm doing this topic justice

388
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,660
because I find it incredibly fascinating

389
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:27,380
and I hope you do too hey this video is
