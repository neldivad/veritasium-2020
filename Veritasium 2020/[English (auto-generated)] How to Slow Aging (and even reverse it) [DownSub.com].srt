3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,569
of the show this is a video about

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,780
research into slowing the rate of Aging

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,750
and extending the human lifespan so

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,780
before I film this I wanted to know what

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,520
do you guys generally think about such

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,039
research and I made a Twitter poll where

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,810
I found that the majority of people were

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,250
supportive and thought there should be

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,289
more of it but there were some important

12
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:26,550
concerns and I want to address those

13
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,680
here at the beginning I mean the most

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,990
significant concern was if we're looking

15
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,090
to extend human lifespan does that just

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,880
mean we'll have more sick years where

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,770
we'll be in bed with Alzheimer's nobody

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,530
wants that and that was clear to me but

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,450
the professor that I was interviewing

20
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,160
for this video professor David Sinclair

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,430
points out that as you get older the

22
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,829
risk of Horrible diseases things like

23
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,399
diabetes and cancer and arthritis all

24
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,460
those sorts of things it increases

25
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,430
exponentially and so if this research is

26
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,160
successful the whole point of it will be

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,069
to forestall those sorts of diseases I

28
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,830
mean if you really are tackling aging

29
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,290
then you should also see that those

30
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,530
age-related diseases do not set in so

31
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,070
quickly

32
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,470
so the point of slowing aging and

33
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,170
extending human lifespan is to extend

34
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,259
the healthy lifespan also called the

35
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,869
health span the other concerns I saw

36
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,700
were that people were saying well this

37
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,200
could be used only for the wealthy and

38
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,290
increase inequality or it could increase

39
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,960
the population of the earth causing you

40
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,150
know garbage more co2 you know where the

41
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,590
resources to feed all these people I

42
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,900
think these are valid concerns but

43
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,090
they're not part of the scope of this

44
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,829
video so if you want to discuss them in

45
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,780
the comments feel free but the point of

46
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,450
this video is to address can we slow

47
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,060
aging in humans can we extend the

48
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,970
lifespan and the health span and what

49
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,219
does that look like how do we do it okay

50
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,009
so for this video I traveled up to the

51
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,500
bodega Marine Lab which is north of San

52
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,719
Francisco and there I got to see some

53
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,719
moon jellyfish now it's fascinating

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,030
about these moon jellyfishes some people

55
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,580
consider them and more

56
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,920
how can that be so all these jellyfish

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,410
have this complex life cycle where they

58
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,810
start off as a polyp which is basically

59
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,910
like a small sea anemone and then

60
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,440
they'll go through a metamorphosis and

61
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,720
become a Medusa and the Medusa stage is

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,100
what we generally think of when we think

63
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,320
about a jellyfish and in most of these

64
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,310
species the polyps are generally able to

65
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,830
asexually reproduce and they can

66
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,530
regenerate if tissue is cut off of them

67
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,630
or if they're damaged and they don't

68
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,640
have any clear evidence of senescence

69
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,450
which is the term for biological aging

70
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,680
so they appear to have some degree of

71
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,870
immortality no one had reported their

72
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,420
ability to do this until I think this

73
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,630
was 2015 so do moon jellyfish hold the

74
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,870
key to slowing aging and extending our

75
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,670
lifespan could they help us live forever

76
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,060
before I got into making this video I

77
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,340
would have put this sort of research in

78
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,610
the same category as downloading your

79
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,920
brain your consciousness into a computer

80
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,709
like I can see how maybe that would work

81
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,750
but I don't think we're anywhere near

82
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,670
that because we don't even understand

83
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,870
how the brain works or how memories are

84
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,690
stored so that seems like serious

85
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,640
science fiction so I would have put say

86
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,370
extending the human lifespan to 120 150

87
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,970
and Beyond in the same category but

88
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,769
after reading professor Sinclair's book

89
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:34,290
and doing an interview with him I think

90
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,860
it seems much more possible and in fact

91
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,880
plausible that will make some progress

92
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,239
over controlling Aging in our lifetimes

93
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,660
now if you want to slow aging the first

94
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,360
question you need to answer is why do we

95
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,920
age in the first place I mean what

96
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,130
really is aging I've made a video in the

97
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,190
past about telomeres these are the end

98
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,799
caps on your chromosomes and every time

99
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,989
a cell divides the telomere gets a bit

100
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:03,260
shorter so it was thought that these

101
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,640
telomeres are kind of like the tips of

102
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,959
your shoelaces and they prevent the

103
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,750
chromosome from fraying but there are

104
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,470
other signs in older bodies that you

105
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,989
have old cells there are an accumulation

106
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,430
of things they're called senescent cells

107
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,500
they're essentially these zombie-like

108
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,959
stels that just go on living in your

109
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,080
body and inflaming the cells around them

110
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,280
there's poor intercellular communication

111
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,990
there's mitochondrial dysfunction those

112
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,610
are the powerhouses of the cell there

113
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,440
are these eight or nine different

114
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,009
features of older cells and they are the

115
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:39,680
hallmarks of aging but the question is

116
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,129
are they the cause of aging or are they

117
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:45,319
kind of the result of a deeper root

118
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,050
cause in the middle of the last century

119
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,770
the hypothesis was that it was damaged

120
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,990
to our DNA mutations to our DNA that

121
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,520
happened of the course of our lives that

122
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,620
led us to be older but evidence since

123
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,419
then has suggested that that is not

124
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,879
really the case when you can take an

125
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,349
adult cell and you can clone it into a

126
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:12,949
new organism and that organism appears

127
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:16,099
to live about as long as non cloned

128
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:17,629
organisms of the same species

129
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:20,300
now the first shaped Dolly the sheep had

130
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,169
a short lifespan

131
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:23,479
she died early but cloned animals you

132
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:26,240
can now clone a monkey you can clone

133
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,310
dogs in fact barbra streisand the

134
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,650
actress she cloned her dogs and they're

135
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,779
expected to live a normal lifespan so in

136
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:34,099
that way it seems like all the

137
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:37,159
information is still there in the DNA so

138
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,840
if we're not losing information in our

139
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,860
DNA then what is the reason for aging

140
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,229
well professor Sinclair suspects that

141
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:48,229
it's a loss of information but not the

142
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:51,919
information in our DNA in our genome no

143
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,870
professor Sinclair suspects that the

144
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,310
loss of information is in our EPI genome

145
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,400
so what is the epigenome every cell in

146
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,990
your body has the same DNA but different

147
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,479
cell types have different epigenomes

148
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,759
they have different ways of packaging

149
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,699
that DNA coiling up you know a lot of it

150
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:16,639
so that it's not red and leaving some

151
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,590
parts of the DNA spooled out so it's

152
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,840
easier to transcribe and turn into

153
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,930
proteins and run that cell so the

154
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,479
epigenome is responsible for turning on

155
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,210
or turning off different parts of the

156
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,610
DNA the way it does that is with

157
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,979
proteins called histones that

158
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:36,630
essentially the DNA is wrapped on

159
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,420
and also things like methylation so

160
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,030
there's these chemical signaling markers

161
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,830
which are placed on the DNA in certain

162
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,710
positions so the idea is when your body

163
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,100
is first forming the epigenome is what

164
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,220
tells your cells what type of cell to be

165
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,660
but as you get older

166
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,730
professor Sinclair's hypothesis is that

167
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,950
we are losing information in the

168
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,870
epigenome and that's important because

169
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,450
if a skin cell needs to remain a skin

170
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,460
cell that's the epigenome

171
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,310
and if you don't have the epigenome the

172
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,990
skin cell will forget what type of cell

173
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,670
it is and it might turn into a brain

174
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,650
cell which may not be that bad but if

175
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,480
your brain turns into a skin cell you've

176
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,370
got a problem and I think that's largely

177
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,080
what aging is I've gotta say like

178
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,480
there's some weird like hair patches

179
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,340
like on my shoulder that have happened

180
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,520
as I've gotten older is that a cell like

181
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,560
doing the wrong thing are those meant to

182
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,630
be skin cells so they screwing up or is

183
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,600
this just some I don't know no no weird

184
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,920
stuff happens when you get older right

185
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,780
you start to get hair growing where it

186
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,650
shouldn't ears nose back that's cells

187
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,500
losing their identity cells go I can't

188
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,090
remember what I'm supposed to do I'm not

189
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,460
reading the right genes anymore so the

190
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,100
key to this sort of breakdown of the

191
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,320
epigenome is DNA damage yeah so when you

192
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,240
go out in the Sun and not like today but

193
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,920
on a day where there's a lot of Sun

194
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,470
you'll break your chromosomes and in the

195
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,630
effort that the cells go to to stick the

196
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,120
chromosome back together note the DNA

197
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,380
isn't just flailing around it's actually

198
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,740
bundled up the cell has to unwrap it

199
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,170
recruit proteins to help join it

200
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,820
together and then they have to go back

201
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,010
and reset the structures and that

202
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,830
resetting of the epigenome happens about

203
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:25,610
99% that 1% is the aging process

204
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,180
so overtime histones are not returned to

205
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,789
the right places and DNA methylation is

206
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:35,809
added in places where it shouldn't be we

207
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,419
can read that methylation pattern and I

208
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,969
could tell you how old you are exactly

209
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,690
and when you're even gonna die how could

210
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,610
you tell that well the it's a clock we

211
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,620
call it the Horvath clock named after my

212
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,300
good friend Steve Horvath and so these

213
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,830
little chemicals that accumulate on the

214
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,260
DNA like plaque on the teeth we can read

215
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,720
that and the more you have the older you

216
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,120
are biologically so you might only be 40

217
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,760
you're younger than 40 of course you you

218
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,980
know I'm 50 now but I might be

219
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,070
biologically 60 actually I was and I

220
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,930
changed my life and then the test said I

221
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,300
was biologically 31 I mean one of the

222
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,560
things I found really interesting was

223
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,070
you found a way to make mice age faster

224
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,660
so how'd you do that

225
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,970
well the clock of aging is due to the

226
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,890
loss of the information in the cell and

227
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,020
one way to accelerate that is to go

228
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,480
break a chromosome instead of going in

229
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,100
the Sun we engineered a mouse where we

230
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,170
could break its chromosomes not enough

231
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,990
to cause mutations the cells put the DNA

232
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,399
back together so we didn't lose any

233
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,649
genetic information but if we're right

234
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:38,959
about the epigenetic information theory

235
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,180
of aging those mice should get old and

236
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,760
that's exactly what happened that's gray

237
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,890
it's got a hunchback it's got dementia

238
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,290
all its organs look old but the real

239
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,930
test was what if we measured that DNA

240
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,760
clock the what we call the DNA

241
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,550
methylation clock and we measured it and

242
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,279
those mice were actually 50% older than

243
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,560
mice that we didn't treat so that isn't

244
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,360
just a mouse that looks old

245
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,180
that Mouse literally is older what's

246
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,589
interesting about this hypothesis is

247
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:09,410
that if it's true if the noise

248
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,480
accumulating the epigenome is really

249
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,700
what's causing aging well then there are

250
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,329
steps we can take right now to slow the

251
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:20,029
rate of Aging in our bodies by trying to

252
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:23,060
better maintain our epigenomes so how do

253
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,230
we do that there's this theory that

254
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,260
billions of years ago early bacteria

255
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,350
took an important evolutionary step they

256
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,329
actually developed two different modes

257
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:38,010
of living when times were good

258
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,900
they used their energy to grow and

259
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,570
reproduce but when conditions were tough

260
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,180
they used their energy to protect and

261
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,580
repair their cells they evolved what

262
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,850
professor Sinclair calls longevity genes

263
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,740
these genes triggered by adversity

264
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,190
create enzymes which among other things

265
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,710
maintain the epigenome and today those

266
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,200
same longevity genes can be found in

267
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,560
bacteria and us we have these or metic

268
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,540
response genes or longevity genes that

269
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,580
are in all of our cells and they sense

270
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,680
when we've run a lot we've lost our

271
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,450
breath or we're hungry we were a little

272
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,070
bit hot but a little bit cold that these

273
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,960
genes are turning on our general

274
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,880
defenses against aging so what is that

275
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,670
so parts of our cells fall apart they

276
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,780
can put them back together

277
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,300
proteins miss fold they can get rid of

278
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,310
them or put them back together the ends

279
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,960
of the chromosomes get shorter they can

280
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,940
lengthen them a lot of processes that go

281
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,710
on but one of the most important I think

282
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,810
is maintaining the information the

283
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,180
epigenetic information in a cell so that

284
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,470
our cells don't forget what to do

285
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,970
there are three types of longevity gene

286
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,440
they're the ones we work on called

287
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,120
sirtuins and they control the

288
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,490
information in the cell in fact sir in

289
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,500
the sirtuin stands for silent

290
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,350
information regulator number two there

291
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,910
are other ones the other group is called

292
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,450
EMP kinase or AMPK this group of genes

293
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,910
senses how much energy were we're taking

294
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,890
in for mostly in the form of sugar and

295
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,140
then the third group is called mTOR and

296
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,690
these genes control and respond to how

297
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,690
much amino acids were taking in so if

298
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,820
you eat a giant steak you've got a lot

299
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,000
of amino acids coming into your body

300
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,010
that'll actually prevent mTOR from

301
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,260
hunkering down and keeping you being

302
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,030
longer lived so the mouse experiments

303
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,340
actually bear this out the best way to

304
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,100
make a mouse live longer is to reduce

305
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,340
the amount of time it eats so periodic

306
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,040
fasting intermittent fasting to keep it

307
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,680
a little bit cool and to restrict its

308
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,650
amino acids that's the recipe for long

309
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,630
life for a mouse and it's true for

310
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,100
monkeys as well they've been calorie

311
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,080
restricted studies where these monkeys

312
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,970
for 15 years didn't eat as much food as

313
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,440
the ones that gorged themselves whenever

314
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,390
they wanted and they were protected

315
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,760
they didn't just age slower they didn't

316
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,900
get as much died

317
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,580
and heart disease they're actually fit

318
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,470
and healthy when the control group

319
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,270
eating whatever they wanted aged and

320
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,250
became sick quicker when some people

321
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,680
think about eating less like calorie

322
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,200
restriction as a way to extend their

323
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,790
life that doesn't seem like a very

324
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,160
pleasant way to extend life I mean to be

325
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,580
hungry for longer so are there other

326
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,700
ways to you know mimic that effect or to

327
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,280
simulate that there are these molecules

328
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,970
that turn on the sirtuin pathway and

329
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,070
trick the body and so for example in the

330
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,470
lab if I give some of our mice a

331
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,500
molecule called nmn which raises the

332
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,950
level of a chemical called nad you get

333
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,230
hyperactive defenses in the body and

334
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,270
what did you see in these you know

335
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,690
senescent mice that you gave in a mentor

336
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,820
well we had a bit of an incident these

337
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
mice that we gave nmn to ran 50% further

338
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,500
but actually some of them ran so far

339
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,540
that the Machine the little treadmill

340
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,400
stopped working and we had to reprogram

341
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,160
the software because this program had

342
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,390
never seen a mouse that ran more than

343
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,300
three kilometres three kilometers for a

344
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,970
mouse for an old Mouse they outran the

345
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,770
young mice and that's like an

346
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,140
ultramarathon for us that would be

347
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,750
probably like taking a 70 year old and

348
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,850
making them run faster than a 20 year

349
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,550
old further yes so these are ultra

350
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,650
marathoners and if we did that to humans

351
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,240
imagine you could have 90 year olds

352
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,450
winning Olympic medals so to sum up

353
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,430
there are six things that you can do

354
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,920
right now to slow the rate of your aging

355
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,700
starting with zero avoid DNA damage wear

356
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,680
sunscreen avoid x-rays and all that sort

357
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:28,980
of stuff

358
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,450
number one eat less caloric restriction

359
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,240
number two eat less protein because your

360
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,160
body has ways of detecting how much of

361
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,470
that you're taking in number three do

362
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,270
some exercise high-intensity interval

363
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,550
training get your heart rate up to 85%

364
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,170
make your body feel like you're running

365
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,990
from a lion or something number four be

366
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,230
uncomfortably cold or number five be

367
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,890
uncomfortably hot all of these things

368
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,740
will trigger your body's longevity genes

369
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,340
into maintaining your epigenome going in

370
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,579
to repair and protect mode rather

371
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:06,769
then grow and reproduce if you think

372
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:09,019
about those things those are generally

373
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:10,639
all the things that we don't do

374
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,269
but what if slowing aging isn't enough

375
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:16,279
for you well this is where my interview

376
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,569
with professor Sinclair took an

377
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:19,459
interesting turn because he's actually

378
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:23,749
done some research on reversing aging so

379
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:25,910
how would you do that well effectively

380
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,949
you would need to take the epigenome and

381
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:31,790
reset it back to an earlier time but how

382
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,399
is that possible back in 2012 a

383
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,249
scientist named Yamanaka received the

384
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:40,369
Nobel Prize for discovering four factors

385
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:43,459
which when applied in a gene therapy to

386
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:46,069
an adult cell would reset the whole

387
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:49,189
epigenome back to how that cell was when

388
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:51,949
it was an embryo so it is what is called

389
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:55,429
a pluripotent stem cell now you wouldn't

390
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:57,470
want to apply that to your entire body

391
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,720
because well then you would turn into a

392
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,610
giant tumor because your cells wouldn't

393
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,129
know how to differentiate but it does

394
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,829
suggest that there are ways of resetting

395
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:09,199
your epigenome and they could be the key

396
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,509
to reversing aging the big breakthrough

397
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:14,299
that we just had in my lab finally you

398
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:16,129
know about a year or so ago was to

399
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:19,999
reprogram the eye of a mouse and the eye

400
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:21,769
we chose the eye because that's a very

401
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:24,169
hard thing to fix right if you go blind

402
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:26,119
when you're older we think that's a

403
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,439
one-way thing you're never going to

404
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:29,899
recover your vision but we decided let's

405
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:31,879
try it anyway let's let's go for broke

406
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:34,160
so we put a gene therapy in the eye of

407
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,669
old mice turn their retinas to be young

408
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:39,679
again reversed Aging in their retinas

409
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,689
so those one-year old mice went back to

410
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:44,419
about two months and guess what those

411
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:46,129
mice could see again just like they were

412
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:49,730
young and again how do you reset one of

413
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,679
these eye cells without resetting it to

414
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,649
just a stem cell well we have to be very

415
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:57,019
careful not to reset these cells to be

416
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:59,779
basically a stem cell otherwise we

417
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:01,939
wouldn't have mice they can see we'd

418
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,499
have mice with a giant tumor in the back

419
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:05,388
of their eyes so what we do is a couple

420
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:07,760
of things we didn't use all of the for

421
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,740
reprogramming factors that won the Nobel

422
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,260
Prize we use just three we leave off one

423
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,480
called Mik which causes cancer and those

424
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,880
three seem to be just the right recipe

425
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,470
for taking the age of

426
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,919
the I backwoods but not too far then the

427
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,689
second thing we do is we turn it off we

428
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:25,970
can actually turn this system on when we

429
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,189
want and off again so that we don't take

430
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:31,280
them too far back in age can you do that

431
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,200
with any cell we think we can do this in

432
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,600
any tissue where we've now given it to

433
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,190
the whole mouse and those mice are fine

434
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,590
no evidence of cancer they seem to be

435
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,419
really quite healthy so the big question

436
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:44,270
is can you take a mouse way back the

437
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,000
whole body and be totally young in maybe

438
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,190
back from two years back to two months

439
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,039
and that's what we're doing right now

440
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,620
that's pretty exciting it's freakishly

441
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,169
exciting actually I thought we just slow

442
00:17:57,169 --> 00:17:58,580
down aging now we're talking about an

443
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,650
aging reset you know what we've only

444
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,740
reset the age of the eye once how many

445
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,600
times can we do this maybe it's twice

446
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,270
maybe it's a hundred times so professor

447
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,549
Sinclair claims that his gene therapy

448
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:13,159
reversed Aging in the mouse's eye and

449
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,070
allowed it to see again but applying a

450
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,200
gene therapy to every one of your

451
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,429
trillion cells is pretty impossible so

452
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:24,919
in order for this to actually work and

453
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:27,650
reset an entire body you would need

454
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,200
another way and this is where the

455
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,110
jellyfish come in because moon jellyfish

456
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,630
any cell in an adult jellyfish can

457
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,590
actually be reset into an earlier stage

458
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,200
of its life cycle it can become a polyp

459
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,780
again so it seems like the jellyfish are

460
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,500
actually capable of activating something

461
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,080
like the Yamanaka factors and resetting

462
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,299
their epigenomes to an earlier time in

463
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,820
their lives if we're able to figure out

464
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,580
how they do that well then maybe we

465
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,730
could do the same with our own cells we

466
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,740
do have the ability to reset our

467
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,440
epigenomes but that is typically only

468
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,000
used when we're in the embryonic stage

469
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,220
when we need to maintain all our cells

470
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,460
as stem cells as we age most mammals

471
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,669
including humans we lose stem cells over

472
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:18,140
time and the stem cells we do have

473
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,179
become more and more restricted over

474
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:21,530
time into the types of cells they can

475
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,440
make so if we can understand how the

476
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,230
moon jellyfish can take presumably many

477
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,960
different kinds of cells

478
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,420
and reverse-engineer them into the cells

479
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,580
that needs during regeneration that

480
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,020
might give us an idea how to do it in

481
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,590
ourselves as well so I still think were

482
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,200
a fair ways off from reversing aging in

483
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,140
the entire human body but what I found

484
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,970
interesting from talking to professor

485
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,710
Sinclair was that there's at least a

486
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,950
roadmap at least a path ahead where you

487
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,080
can see that it could be possible to

488
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,450
slow and even reverse aging

489
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,470
hey this part of the video is sponsored

490
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,020
by LastPass so let's talk about one

491
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,640
thing you can do right now to improve

492
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,250
your life just go to LastPass calm and

cross-device sync think about how

495
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,760
spending just a few moments right now

496
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,250
could save you hours or even days over

497
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,690
the course of your life and that's

498
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,430
because you will never again get locked

499
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,960
out of an account you'll never have to

500
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,270
reset a password you'll no longer have

501
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,010
to burden your brain with remembering

502
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,870
passwords or end up having to write them

503
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,180
down and it will make your passwords

504
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,130
more secure because LastPass Auto

505
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,290
generates strong passwords for you I

506
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,930
love how it auto fills usernames and

507
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,300
passwords on websites and it works just

508
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,550
as well on iOS or Android apps and

509
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,190
mobile sites just think about how much

510
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,410
hassle in time this will save you if you

511
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,090
end up living to like a hundred or a

512
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,220
hundred and twenty I mean how many

513
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,810
accounts and passwords will you even

514
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,540
have by then and if you want extra

515
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,130
features like advanced multi-factor

516
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,870
authentication you can upgrade to

517
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,540
