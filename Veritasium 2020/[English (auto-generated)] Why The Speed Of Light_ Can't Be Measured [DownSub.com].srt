this video was sponsored by kiwiko more

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,000
about kiwiko at the end of the show

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,320
i know what you're thinking clickbait no

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,240
one has measured the speed of light

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,480
that's ridiculous the speed of light is

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,920
exactly 299 million 792

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,279
458 meters per second we are so sure of

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,359
it that since 1983 we've actually

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,119
used the speed of light to define how

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,480
long a meter is

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,400
it's just the distance light travels in

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,560
a vacuum in one over two nine nine

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,760
seven nine two 792 458 of a second that

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,719
definition

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,880
ensures that the speed of light is

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,920
exactly

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,960
this number no decimals but

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,680
hear me out in this video i will prove

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,879
to you that light

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,920
may never actually travel at this speed

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,399
and i can say that because no one has

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,039
actually

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,199
measured it we can't measure the speed

24
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,719
of light the same way we measure the

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,199
speed

26
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:59,840
of anything else

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,760
i think we're recording everywhere what

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,519
are we doing this is a video about

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,920
measuring the speed of stuff okay tell

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,000
me about how you measured the speed

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,200
of the baseball fired out of your cannon

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,479
well to get the speed of the baseball

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,000
you need to know two things you need to

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,119
know the distance

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,880
between two points and you need to know

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,560
the time that it takes the baseball to

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,240
travel between those points

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,320
so basically we took distance divided by

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,920
time and that's the speed of the

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,880
baseball

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,240
and in our case we were shooting with a

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,079
high speed camera so you basically just

43
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,200
count the frames

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,280
and then your clock is internal oh

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,640
you're going relativity you're gonna do

46
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,560
something weird aren't you

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,799
you saw it coming i can't believe it oh

48
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,040
man the thing i want to ask you about

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,159
is the speed of light okay could you

50
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,600
measure the speed of light like this

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,240
imagine you have a laser that can fire a

52
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,960
beam through

53
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,000
a perfect vacuum for one kilometer start

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,640
a timer

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,360
the instant you fire the laser beam then

56
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,119
exactly when it hits the end

57
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,240
stop the clock except how do you know

58
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,159
when light reaches one kilometer

59
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,320
if you and the clock are at the starting

60
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,600
point

61
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,399
okay so you need two clocks one at the

62
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,160
laser and one at the end

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,760
which stops automatically when it

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,680
detects the laser light

65
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,599
but now how do you make sure your two

66
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,360
clocks are synchronized

67
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,520
well you could connect them via a wire

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,239
and send a pulse from one to the other

69
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,160
but that pulse will travel at the speed

70
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,280
of light so

71
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,760
it will arrive with a time delay you

72
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,480
might think

73
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,560
you can just subtract that time delay

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,720
but is equal to the time it takes for

75
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,560
light to travel one kilometer

76
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,640
that's what we don't know and are trying

77
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,800
to measure

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,360
okay new plan start with the clocks

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,080
together

80
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,800
and sync them up first and then send one

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,879
of the clocks down to the end

82
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,080
now what could possibly go wrong

83
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,760
well i'll tell you the clock at the

84
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,360
finish line was moving with respect to

85
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,400
the one at the start

86
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,640
and special relativity tells us moving

87
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,800
clocks tick slow relative to stationary

88
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,760
observers

89
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,760
so by the time the clock reaches one

90
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,239
kilometer it will no longer be in sync

91
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,000
with the clock at the start

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,239
can i tell you the only solution to this

93
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,360
problem

94
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,159
ditch the second clock put a mirror at

95
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,239
the end to reflect the light back

96
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,319
and use a single clock at the start to

97
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,120
time the full two kilometer round trip

98
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,840
wasn't this actually done before he was

99
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,519
on a mountain and there's a wagon wheel

100
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,120
with a lantern

101
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,720
and there's something like a mirror on

102
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,760
the other side of the mountain i've

103
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,200
always wanted to do this

104
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,480
so uh that sounds a little like how the

105
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,599
speed of light was first

106
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,000
experimentally measured by epolite fizzo

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,599
in 1849

108
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,599
he shot a beam of light between the

109
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,840
teeth of a rapidly spinning gear to a

110
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,560
mirror

111
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,879
up on a hill eight kilometers away and

112
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,599
then by

113
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,200
increasing the speed of the gear he

114
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,799
reached a point where the reflected

115
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,640
light passed through the next gap on the

116
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,200
gear

117
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,519
and so it was observed so he measured

118
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,680
the speed of light to be

119
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,760
313 000 kilometers per second

120
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
which is within five percent of the

121
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
presently accepted value

122
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,760
so someone has measured the speed of

123
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,360
light

124
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,159
or have they what has been measured is

125
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:10,480
the

126
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,120
round trip or two-way speed of light but

127
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,519
no one has measured the one-way

128
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,519
speed of light one thing i'm going to

129
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,358
throw at you and i'm just going to

130
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,120
i'm just going to come out and tell you

131
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,759
it's like what if the speed of light

132
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,120
in this direction is different from the

133
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,280
speed of light in this direction

134
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,960
then that sounds like a veritasium video

135
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,759
the question is could you figure it out

136
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,360
the kind of crux of this problem

137
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
is that the only way people have managed

138
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,720
to measure the speed of light

139
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,440
is for a round trip no one's ever

140
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,120
managed to measure the speed of light in

141
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,479
just one direction

142
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,960
it's possible that the speed of light is

143
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,520
half

144
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,919
of c in one direction and then

145
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,680
instantaneous on the return journey

146
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,840
what that's that's possible are you

147
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,360
serious

148
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,880
think about communicating with an

149
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
astronaut stranded on mars

150
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,720
let's call him mark we send out a signal

151
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,680
and get a response 20 minutes later

152
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
so we imagine our signal takes 10

153
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,440
minutes to get there

154
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,520
and the reply takes 10 minutes to come

155
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,479
back

156
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,199
but it's possible that our message took

157
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,520
all

158
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,240
20 minutes to get there and the reply

159
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,000
came back

160
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,720
instantaneously there's no way we could

161
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,400
tell the difference between these two

162
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,919
scenarios

163
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,840
but why would the speed of light be

164
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,280
different well

165
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,199
it's possible that there is some

166
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,759
preferred direction through space-time

167
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,360
i mean our universe has a lot of

168
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,440
symmetries but there is also some

169
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,400
asymmetry

170
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,280
for example why is there so much matter

171
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,280
relative to antimatter

172
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,960
and physicists have worked out

173
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,639
internally consistent theories of

174
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,240
physics in which the speed of light

175
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,199
is different forwards and in reverse the

176
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,199
speed of light could vary by just a few

177
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,240
percent

178
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,120
up to at the extreme going c over two in

179
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,080
one direction and

180
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,360
infinitely fast in the other direction

181
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,160
okay so let me let me figure this out so

182
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,840
yeah i

183
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,000
i kind of don't believe you i kind of

184
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,880
don't believe you

185
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,960
i don't believe you that light is a

186
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,560
different speed in one direction but in

187
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,919
the other but i know you well enough to

188
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,199
know that you wouldn't

189
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,479
you wouldn't call me and put a camera

190
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,720
on me unless you knew you were right and

191
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,199
that's what scares me about this

192
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,919
that scares me

193
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,039
now you might think it is just simpler

194
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,560
that light should travel at the same

195
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,240
speed in all directions

196
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,360
but the truth is that is a convention

197
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,600
rather than an experimentally verified

198
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,919
fact

199
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,560
einstein himself pointed this out in his

200
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,479
famous 1905 paper

201
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,800
on the electrodynamics of moving bodies

202
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,960
he spends the first couple of pages

203
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,880
on the problem of synchronizing clocks

204
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,400
at different locations a

205
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,360
and b and he says there is no way that

206
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
we can meaningfully compare the times

207
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,319
they measure

208
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,039
unless we establish by definition that

209
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,880
the time required by light to travel

210
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,000
from a to b

211
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
equals the time it requires to travel

212
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,240
from b to a

213
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,240
he's essentially defining that the speed

214
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,919
of light in opposite directions

215
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,199
is the same and he puts by definition in

216
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,720
italics to remind us

217
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,800
that this is only a convention it's

218
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,720
known as the einstein synchronization

219
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,000
convention

220
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,160
so the idea that the speed of light is

221
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,919
the same in opposite directions

222
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,400
as einstein would later write is neither

223
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,039
a supposition nor a hypothesis about the

224
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,560
physical nature of light

225
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,759
but a stipulation that i can make of my

226
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,240
own free will to arrive at a definition

227
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,240
of simultaneity

228
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,479
that sounds a lot more subjective than

229
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,840
how i think most people

230
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,360
would imagine the speed of light is

231
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
defined dude

232
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,240
this is hardcore

233
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,800
i've never thought about this i didn't

234
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,319
think about this before either i always

235
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,680
assumed that when we said

236
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,360
the speed of light is c we meant the

237
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,120
one-way speed of light there's no way to

238
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,800
define the one-way speed of light

239
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,240
so the only thing we can really define

240
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,840
is the two-way speed of light just

241
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,560
look at the way einstein defines c it's

242
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,080
for the round trip from a

243
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,800
to b and back i don't know if you saw in

244
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,160
your physics classes but whenever there

245
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,599
was a light clock

246
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,199
it would always bounce the light up and

247
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,520
then back you would never see a light

248
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,000
clock just bounce slight one way

249
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,560
and this is why the only thing we can be

250
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,039
certain

251
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,599
is constant for all inertial observers

252
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,919
is the two-way speed of light

253
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,399
for over a hundred years scientists have

254
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,320
tried to find a way around this

255
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,399
to measure the one-way speed of light by

256
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,599
itself

257
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,958
here is a paper published in the

258
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,279
american journal of physics in 2009 that

259
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,200
claims to measure the one-way speed of

260
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,080
light

261
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,320
and here is the paper debunking this

262
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,000
study pointing out that these authors

263
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,760
were actually measuring the two-way

264
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,200
speed of light

265
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,279
but i'm imagining you might have some

266
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,040
ideas for how to measure the one-way

267
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,160
speed of light so

268
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,000
let's go through some of them i mean

269
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,920
can't we just use a high-speed camera

270
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,600
that shoots at a trillion frames a

271
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,640
second so we can

272
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,480
actually see light passing through an

273
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,959
object the problem is you're not

274
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,480
only seeing the light pass through the

275
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,080
object you're also seeing it bounce back

276
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,120
to the camera

277
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,720
measuring the two-way speed not one way

278
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,839
here you go get a spool of fiber optic

279
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,720
cable

280
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,920
you know i don't know like 186 000 miles

281
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,360
and then and you could shine the light

282
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,959
here and you have the other end of the

283
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,160
fiber here and you could

284
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,000
shine here and then wait and see the

285
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,080
delay see if it's one second later over

286
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,480
here

287
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,160
the thing is like that fiber's going

288
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,600
around and around and around so

289
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,519
it could be that when the light goes

290
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,279
this way over the top of the

291
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,279
loop it goes slower and then when it

292
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,440
goes on the bottom it goes faster

293
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,519
it all averages out in the fiber and

294
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,880
you're you're essentially getting lots

295
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,320
of round trips in that fiber

296
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,240
so you're never getting a one way what

297
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,480
if you center a synchronizing device

298
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,920
between your two clocks

299
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,279
and send out simultaneous pulses well

300
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,720
if the speed of light is the same in

301
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,560
both directions this perfectly

302
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,240
synchronizes your clocks

303
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,160
but if the speed of light is different

304
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,279
in each direction

305
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,959
one of the clocks will be ahead of the

306
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,959
other and it will be ahead by

307
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,959
just the right amount so that when you

308
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,320
measure the speed of light

309
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,120
you will find the value to be c even

310
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,839
though

311
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,600
that was not the speed the light was

312
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,000
traveling this is the same reason

313
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,640
gps synchronized clocks won't work the

314
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,040
whole

315
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
gps system is based on the assumption

316
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,800
that the speed of light is the same in

317
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,000
all directions

318
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,680
if the speed of light is different in

319
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,680
different directions the light pulses

320
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,720
from satellites

321
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,959
will travel at different speeds so the

322
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,880
clocks won't be properly synced

323
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
by that i mean they will always measure

324
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,480
c for the one-way speed of light

325
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,160
whether it is or isn't

326
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,399
how about starting with synchronized

327
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,680
clocks in the middle

328
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,920
and moving them apart with equal and

329
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,279
opposite speeds

330
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,880
that way the time dilation for each

331
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,720
clock will be the same and they'll still

332
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,600
be synchronized

333
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,800
when they reach the end points but again

334
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,200
this only works if the speed of light in

335
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
each direction is the same

336
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,160
if the speed of light depends on

337
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,240
direction then so does

338
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,720
time dilation you might think you could

339
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,680
move the clocks

340
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,760
really really slowly so that time

341
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,680
dilation is negligible

342
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,519
but if the speed of light is different

343
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,800
in different directions

344
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,200
you can't just use the standard formula

345
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
to calculate what that time dilation

346
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,279
would be i mean it could be a lot worse

347
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,480
than you think

348
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,360
so the reality is we're stuck we need

349
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,800
synchronized clocks to measure the

350
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,000
one-way speed of light

351
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,680
but we need to know the one-way speed of

352
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,480
light in order to synchronize our clocks

353
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,920
now this might sound like just an

354
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,240
academic concern so i want to go through

355
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,920
an example to illustrate just how

356
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,440
differently the universe works

357
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,519
if the speed of light is not the same in

358
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,600
all directions

359
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,320
let's say on mars mark is trying to

360
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,800
synchronize his clock with the earth

361
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,720
at noon mission control sends out a

362
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,839
message that says

363
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,680
this signal was sent at exactly 12

364
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,320
o'clock when mark receives this message

365
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,560
he uses the einstein synchronization

366
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
convention to set his clock

367
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,480
he knows the round-trip time delay is 20

368
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
minutes so he assumes the signal must

369
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,959
have taken 10 minutes to reach him

370
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,600
he programs his clock to 12 10 pm and

371
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,279
sends a return message

372
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,880
this reply sent to 12 10.

373
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,720
the message is received on earth at 12

374
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,399
20 pm so both parties know the

375
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,240
synchronization was successful

376
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,560
when the clock reads 12 20 on earth it

377
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,000
simultaneously reads

378
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,040
1220 on mars

379
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,639
but now consider what happens if the

380
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,399
speed of light is not the same in both

381
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,399
directions

382
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,959
let's say it is c over 2 from earth to

383
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:35,600
mars

384
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,839
and then instantaneous from mars back to

385
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,800
earth

386
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,480
no one knows this of course so they

387
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,880
continue to use the einstein convention

388
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,519
the message is sent from earth but now

389
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,399
it takes a full

390
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,279
20 minutes to reach mars but mark

391
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,320
doesn't know this

392
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,240
and as before he assumes the signal took

393
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,920
10 minutes to reach him so he sets his

394
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,760
clock to 12 10 pm

395
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,639
even though on earth it is now 12 20.

396
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,760
mark then sends

397
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,639
this reply sent to 12 10 pm which is

398
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,959
instantaneously received on earth

399
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,480
at 12 20 earth time

400
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
the experience for the two communicators

401
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,760
is the same

402
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
the same messages were received with the

403
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,600
same local time delays

404
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,839
but their clocks are out of sync by 10

405
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,120
minutes

406
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,040
what they think is the same moment for

407
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,560
the other observer

408
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,279
actually isn't and there is no way they

409
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,639
can ever recognize or

410
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,040
correct this error imagine if someone on

411
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,639
earth immediately responded

412
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,320
how long did this message take to reach

413
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,760
you it's now 12

414
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,839
20. well the message would take 20

415
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,279
minutes to reach mars

416
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,440
but due to the clocks being out of sync

417
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,760
it would arrive at 12 30 mars time

418
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,480
so mark would reply 10 minutes a message

419
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,199
that would

420
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,160
instantaneously reach the earth at 12 40

421
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,240
earth time

422
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,040
the space-time diagram shows how there

423
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
is flexibility in what you consider to

424
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,399
be the same moment

425
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,279
at two different locations and in how

426
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,760
you define the one-way speed of light

427
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,360
einstein chose the convention where the

428
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,880
one-way speed of light is always the

429
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,680
same

430
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,480
but from an experimental perspective any

431
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,360
other convention

432
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,639
is just as valid up to and including one

433
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,399
where the speed of light is c over two

434
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,199
one way

435
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,480
and instantaneous the other way

436
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,639
and in that case it's interesting to

437
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,560
think about what each observer is seeing

438
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,279
when they look

439
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,079
at the other mark would be seeing the

440
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,120
earth as it was

441
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,800
20 minutes ago but earth is seeing mars

442
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,920
in real time exactly as it is

443
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,519
right now and this effect wouldn't stop

444
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,320
at mars

445
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,560
look beyond it and you could see stars

446
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,399
hundreds of light years away

447
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,800
not as they looked centuries ago but

448
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,600
exactly

449
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,440
as they are right this instant

450
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,320
one of the things is you only know about

451
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:52,959
that light

452
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,800
when it reaches you and you don't know

453
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,399
anything about what journey it took to

454
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,600
get to you you just

455
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,360
see it and it's there so like it's

456
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,880
instantaneous

457
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,560
so an instantaneous interpretation of

458
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
that light is just as good as one where

459
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,959
it takes c to reach us

460
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,519
this is breaking my brain yeah yeah i

461
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,199
mean it's it's kind of unknowable isn't

462
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:11,440
it

463
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,040
it is unknowable that's the whole point

464
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,279
of the video is to say

465
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,880
we've all agreed and this is based on

466
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,720
something einstein wrote in 1905 we've

467
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,160
all agreed to just say

468
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,560
it's c in every direction but the truth

469
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
is the physics works the same

470
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,720
whether it's c or the c over two and

471
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,079
instantaneous

472
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,000
or anything in between as long as the

473
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,759
round trip works out to be c

474
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,240
none of physics breaks and that's the

475
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,199
crazy thing

476
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,199
so if we can never measure the one-way

477
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,040
speed of light and if it makes

478
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,519
no difference to any of the laws of

479
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,480
physics

480
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,240
then what's the point in even talking

481
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,600
about it

482
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,519
well that is certainly one valid

483
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,120
perspective in a debate that has been

484
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,360
ongoing since

485
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,120
1905. you know some physicists appeal to

486
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,160
occam's razor

487
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,000
isn't it just simpler if light travels

488
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,320
at the same speed in all directions

489
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,639
most working physicists just accept the

490
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,120
convention and move on with their lives

491
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,639
but i think it's important to point out

492
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,720
that it is just a convention

493
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,720
not an empirically verified fact

494
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,839
personally i find it fascinating that

495
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,839
this is something about the universe

496
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,519
that is hidden from us

497
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,240
sure the round trip speed of light is c

498
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,600
but does the one-way speed

499
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,720
even have a well-defined value and if it

500
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,440
doesn't

501
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,199
what does that mean for the concept of

502
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,720
simultaneity

503
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,920
when is right now on mars

504
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,440
does it even make sense to talk about

505
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,120
things happening at the same time

506
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,759
if they're separated by distance you

507
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,560
know maybe

508
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,199
this is an odd quirk of the universe and

509
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,279
there's no good reason for it

510
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,240
or maybe when physics takes the next

511
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,199
paradomatic leap our inability to

512
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,120
measure the one-way speed of light

513
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,480
will be the obvious clue to the way

514
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,720
general relativity quantum mechanics

515
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,839
space and time are all connected

516
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,000
and we'll wonder why we didn't see it

517
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,400
before

518
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,039
hey this video was sponsored by kiwico

519
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:13,679
they create

520
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,839
awesome projects and toys to get kids

521
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,400
making i use their crates with my son

522
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,240
and they are a lot of fun while also

523
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,439
being educational

524
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,880
now for viewers of this video they are

525
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,119
offering 50 off your first month of any

526
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:25,839
crate

527
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,960
just go to kiwico.com veritasium50

528
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,320
and i'll put that link down in the

529
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,000
description below now

530
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,840
i think this is a fantastic offer

531
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,840
because these crates are a great

532
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,520
resource for learning at home

533
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,679
which is something anyone with kids is

534
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:40,720
doing a lot of

535
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,200
at the moment plus all the supplies you

536
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,000
need come

537
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,080
right in the box which means you don't

538
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,440
need to run to the store

539
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,480
which is again ideal now my kids are

540
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,760
still young but kiwico

541
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,520
offers eight subscription lines for

542
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,880
different age groups and different

543
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,440
topics

544
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,840
i do the koala crates with my oldest who

545
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,960
is now four

546
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,799
but the kit i'm actually showing you

547
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,720
here is for older kids

548
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,280
i built an infinity mirror which is

549
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,960
perfect for talking about the round trip

550
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,080
speed of light

551
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,600
there's lots of round trips going on in

552
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,919
here now can i just tell you how useful

553
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,679
it is to have a box turn up at your door

554
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,000
once

555
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,919
a month that is packed with fun things

556
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,000
to make all the supplies you need and

557
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,400
hours of entertainment right there

558
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,799
plus my son and i are learning something

559
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,520
new together

560
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,000
every month and we're connecting it's

561
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
become a special thing that we do

562
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,600
together so kiwi co is a perfect option

563
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,799

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,720
my son actually got his subscription

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,400
last year at this time

566
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,559

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,520
get kids thinking

568
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,480
and doing throughout the year so for me

569
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,200
that's the most

570
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,600
important part i want my kids to feel

571
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,440
like they can make and discover things

572
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,000
on their own and these crates give them

573
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,120
that confidence
