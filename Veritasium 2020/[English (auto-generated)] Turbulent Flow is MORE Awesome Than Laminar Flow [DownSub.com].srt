a portion of this video was sponsored by

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,700
Cottonelle this is like a scientist trap

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,940
it certainly is case in point that Space

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:17,190
Station commander Chris Hatfield what

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,070
this isn't is turbulent nope

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,039
this is largely laminar flow did

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,160
somebody say laminar flow if you didn't

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,680
know Destin from smarter every day loves

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,230
laminar flow where all the particles of

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,940
the fluid moved parallel to each other

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,149
in organized layers or laminae look at a

12
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,530
bubble where I live people will roll

13
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,300
down the window in their car when they

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,260
see me in the street and they will

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,120
scream turbulent flow is better to me

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,059
that happens that happens in Huntsville

17
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,190
yeah here's my argument to you Destin

18
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,930
that laminar flow is easier to love okay

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,879
but turbulent flow if you make that

20
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,600
effort is actually more awesome um no

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,470
turbulent flow is not better than

22
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,229
laminar it is awesome but it is not

23
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,960
better than laminar flow can I just say

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,970
I get it I get where Destin is coming

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,240
from

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,000
I mean laminar flow is pretty and it's

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
well behaved meanwhile turbulent flow is

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,090
a mess in more ways than one I mean

29
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,790
there isn't even a universally

30
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,009
agreed-upon definition of turbulent flow

31
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,829
you know it when you see it yeah so

32
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,409
instead of a formal definition in this

33
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,689
video we are going to build a checklist

34
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,689
of characteristics of turbulent flow so

35
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,790
that you know it when you see it and the

36
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,860
first characteristic of turbulent flow

37
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,070
is that it is unpredictable that's right

38
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,570
turbulent flow is messy it's

39
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,570
unpredictable it is literally

40
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,520
definitionally chaotic meaning it is

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,200
sensitively dependent on initial

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,060
conditions so if you were to change

43
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,670
something somewhere in the fluid well it

44
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,189
would completely change the final state

45
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,469
and that means you can't make

46
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:06,840
predictions with turbulent flow all you

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,179
can do is speak about it statistically I

48
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,220
mean there are the navier-stokes

49
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,989
equations which are meant to govern all

50
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:13,790
fluid flow

51
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,320
including turbulence but they are

52
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,200
notoriously difficult to solve in fact

53
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,630
there is a million-dollar prize for

54
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,340
anyone who can even make progress

55
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,470
towards getting insight into these

56
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,410
equations that would explain turbulence

57
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,260
so yeah I get it turbulence is a mess

58
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,810
laminar flow is easy to love it's like

59
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,680
the belle of the ball

60
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,200
whereas turbulent flow is kind of an

61
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,960
ugly duckling but in this video I want

62
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,090
to transform that ugly duckling into a

63
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,850
beautiful swan I want you to see that if

64
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,060
you make the effort the love you can

65
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,710
have for turbulent flow is so much

66
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,440
deeper and richer than that superficial

67
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,950
fling you have with laminar flow you are

68
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,810
looking at the motion of air in a room

69
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,590
which is generally turbulent the physics

70
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,690
girl and friends imaged a cross-section

71
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,000
of air using a fog machine and a laser

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,920
sheet one of the defining

73
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,750
characteristics of turbulent flow is

74
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,940
that it consists of many interacting

75
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,820
swirls of fluid also called Eddie's or

76
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,930
vortices these Eddie's span a huge range

77
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,420
of sizes in the case of air in a room

78
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,150
from the micrometer scale all the way up

79
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,210
to meters in diameter can you think of

80
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,680
another physical phenomenon that

81
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,320
exhibits structures over such a range of

82
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,860
sizes but turbulence can be much larger

83
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,650
the surface of the Sun is turbulent as

84
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,770
hot plasma rises to the surface in huge

85
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,200
convection currents the cell like

86
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,510
structures here are roughly the size of

87
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,570
Texas larger still are the turbulent

88
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,270
swirls on Jupiter the Great Red Spot is

89
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,330
a vortex bigger than the earth the rest

90
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,040
of the planet is covered in Eddie's of

91
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,500
all sizes down to the limits of our

92
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,300
ability to measure them from orbiting

93
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,110
spacecraft even the dust between the

94
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,130
stars is in turbulent motion it makes

95
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,440
radio sources twinkle the same way the

96
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,209
turbulence in our atmosphere makes stars

97
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:17,850
twinkle a stunning example of this

98
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,250
turbulent dust is the Orion Nebula

99
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,300
twenty four light years across

100
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,130
turbulence is cosmic in contrast

101
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,390
laminar flow has to be small this was

102
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,750
shown experimentally in 1883 Osborne

103
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,520
Reynolds passed water through a glass

104
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,950
pipe at different flow rates and to

105
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,660
visualize the flow he introduced a

106
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,490
stream of dye in the middle of the pipe

107
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,100
he found at low flow rates the dye

108
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,530
remained in a steady stream laminar flow

109
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,410
but as the flow rate increased the dye

110
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,480
began to oscillate back and forth and

111
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,030
beyond a certain critical point the dye

112
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,460
became completely diffused throughout

113
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,600
the pipe this was turbulent flow

114
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,920
Reynolds had observed another essential

115
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,170
characteristic of turbulence it is

116
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,720
diffusive meaning it mixes things

117
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,390
together turbulent flows caused things

118
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,540
to spread out not only die but also heat

119
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,510
or momentum they all become distributed

120
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,480
throughout the fluid Reynolds found the

121
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,160
transition to turbulence was not only

122
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,440
dependent on the flow rate turbulence

123
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,290
occurred more readily in wider pipes but

124
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,420
less readily with more viscous fluids

125
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,270
things like honey he calculated a

126
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,100
dimensionless quantity now called the

127
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,530
Reynolds number equal to the velocity of

128
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,300
the fluid times the characteristic

129
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,430
length say the diameter of the pipe

130
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,860
divided by the kinematic viscosity of

131
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,750
the fluid which you can think of as a

132
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,140
measure of its internal friction high

133
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,330
Reynolds numbers result in turbulent

134
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,470
flow have a look at the smoke rising

135
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,200
from a candle flame at first its laminar

136
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,660
but the hot gases accelerate as they

137
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,820
rise and once the Reynolds number gets

138
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,070
too big the smoke transitions to

139
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:07,120
turbulence so laminar flow only occurs

140
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,520
at low Reynolds numbers which means it

141
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,910
is limited to low speeds small sizes or

142
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,520
viscous fluids this is why in our

143
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,620
everyday lives most fluid flow is

144
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,010
turbulent turbulent flow is the rule

145
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,440
laminar flow is the exception the air

146
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,120
flowing in and out of your lungs is

147
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,890
turbulent the blood pumping through your

148
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,830
aorta is turbulent the atmosphere near

149
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,690
the surface of the earth is turbulent as

150
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,300
is the air flow in and around cumulus

151
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,060
and cumulonimbus clouds in fact modeling

152
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,010
shows that turbulent flow plays an

153
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,870
essential role in the formation of

154
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,050
rain drops so turbulence literally makes

155
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:50,740
it rain I'm going to create turbulence

156
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,850
in this Rio scopic fluid Rio scopic just

157
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,340
means that it shows the currents and it

158
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,170
does that by having these tiny particles

159
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,170
suspended in the water but what you

160
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,970
notice if you look at this turbulent

161
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,390
flow is that it gradually dies away and

162
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,220
that's because another characteristic of

163
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,680
turbulence is that it's dissipative that

164
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,810
is it takes in energy at the largest

165
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,030
scales at these big Eddie's and then

166
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,040
that energy gets transferred down to

167
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,740
smaller and smaller Eddie's until on the

168
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,870
smallest scales that energy gets

169
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,810
dissipated to the fluid as heat and so

170
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,150
in order to maintain turbulence you need

171
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,550
a constant source of energy something to

172
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,410
keep generating those large Eddie's

173
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,090
which is why we often think about

174
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,490
turbulence around objects that move

175
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,620
through a fluid things like planes cars

176
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,050
or boats so I want to think about the

177
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,870
interface between an object and the

178
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,600
fluid so picture fluid flowing over a

179
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,390
flat surface far away from the surface

180
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,820
the fluid isn't affected it keeps moving

181
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,530
with what will call its free stream

182
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,620
velocity but right at the surface due to

183
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,500
friction and adhesion the molecules of

184
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,270
the fluid are effectively stuck to the

185
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,020
surface their velocity is zero the fluid

186
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,240
next to it can flow only slowly due to

187
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,960
friction with this stationary layer

188
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,940
with increasing distance from the

189
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,860
surface the fluids velocity increases

190
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,380
from zero until it reaches the free

191
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,340
stream velocity and this region of

192
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,530
velocity adjustment is known as a

193
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,840
boundary layer in this case it's a

194
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,870
laminar boundary layer to form this

195
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,180
boundary layer the surface is applying a

196
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,179
force to the fluid that means the fluid

197
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,490
is applying an equal and opposite force

198
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,029
on the surface and this is known as skin

199
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:44,159
friction now if the fluid velocity is

200
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,170
particularly fast or if the surface is

201
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,360
long the boundary layer will grow and

202
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,660
eventually transition to turbulence in a

203
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,700
turbulent boundary layer the fluid

204
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,790
swirls and mixes bringing faster flowing

205
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,940
fluid closer to the surface and this

206
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,029
increases the skin friction so turbulent

207
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:05,130
boundary layers result in significantly

208
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,950
more drag than laminar ones and the

209
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,720
boundary layers around planes and large

210
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,690
ships are mostly turbulent and skin

211
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,070
friction accounts for the majority of

212
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,010
the drag they experience to make matters

213
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,959
worse laminar boundary layers can be

214
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,690
tripped into becoming turbulent by small

215
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,990
obstacles or rough surfaces in practice

216
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,209
this means clean smooth surfaces can

217
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:29,400
significantly reduce drag saving on fuel

218
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,310
costs if your car is really dirty it

219
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,800
likely gets worse gas mileage than if it

220
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,690
were clean this is what the Mythbusters

221
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,880
found when they tested it it also

222
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,890
explains why planes are frequently

223
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,850
washed so when you think about airplanes

224
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,190
I imagine that they would be built as

225
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,890
smooth as possible I think of the scene

226
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,320
in The Aviator where Leo says he wants

227
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,690
all of the rivets shaved down flush and

228
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,420
you can see that with this plane all of

229
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,600
these screws are are set in to the wing

230
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,850
and really to make the smoothest service

231
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,100
possible but then you look over here and

232
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,390
there are these ridges that stick up out

233
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,149
of the plane which seem to make no sense

234
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:14,910
I mean why would you add roughness to

235
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,850
the surface of the wing the answer is

236
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,850
actually to induce turbulence in the

237
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,760
flow of air over the wing

238
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,500
when cruising in level flight air

239
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,720
smoothly follows the curve of the wing

240
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,360
but at low speeds or higher angles of

241
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,940
attack the airflow can separate you can

242
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,830
think of it as not having enough energy

243
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,050
to follow the curve of the wing this

244
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,030
leads to a condition known as stall

245
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,480
which dramatically decreases lift here

246
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,580
you can see the airflow of via strings

247
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,830
taped onto the wing and as the plane

248
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,710
slows the flow separates and the strings

249
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:55,380
go wild this plane has stalled the way

250
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,930
to delay flow separation and stall is by

251
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,360
adding small fins on the wing called

252
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,120
vortex generators what these vortex

253
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,610
generators do is they actually cause

254
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,800
turbulence which mixes the faster

255
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,890
flowing higher up air down closer to the

256
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,710
surface so your energizing that fluid

257
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,540
flow as it passes over the wing and

258
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,870
because that flow has greater energy it

259
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,970
is able to follow the surface of the

260
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,400
wing for longer that means the air flow

261
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,650
remains attached and if you have

262
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,020
attached airflow over the wing then you

263
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,470
can maintain lift so in the case of

264
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,320
airplanes you actually need turbulence

265
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,600
and you induce more turbulence on the

266
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,660
wing in order to fly efficiently and

267
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,550
effectively and be able to climb at

268
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,910
hires angles of attack a similar

269
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,390
principle is at work with golf balls the

270
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,370
skull found out about turbulence the

271
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,620
hard way because they started playing

272
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,900
with a very smooth gospel and it

273
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,930
wouldn't fly as far as it would once it

274
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,540
got sort of dingo nicked and dirty you

275
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,910
can see why by observing the airflow in

276
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,340
a wind tunnel with a smooth ball the air

277
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,830
forms a laminar boundary layer over its

278
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,320
surface this leads to low skin friction

279
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,960
which is a good thing but it also means

280
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,720
the air flow separates easily leaving a

281
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,360
large wake of low pressure turbulent air

282
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,010
behind the ball and that leads to a

283
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,390
different form of drag is that a

284
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,980
pressure difference drag that's right

285
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,850
that's a pressure drag so the boundary

286
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,190
layer itself has a skin friction drag

287
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,900
and then if it separates there's a

288
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,350
pressure drag

289
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,840
and if you force that boundary layer to

290
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,690
become turbulent so you have mud or

291
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,810
roughness or mix on the golf ball then a

292
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,280
turbulent boundary I can actually get

293
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,680
further around the golf ball before it

294
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,170
separates and so it reduces that wake

295
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,270
and reduces that pressure drag so by

296
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,850
reducing the pressure drag more than

297
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,410
your increase in this kind rag that's

298
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,270
right golf ball travels further yep

299
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,700
golfers started carving grooves into

300
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,470
their golf balls before the aerodynamics

301
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,990
of this was fully understood and since

302
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,970
then dimples have found to work the best

303
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,330
for creating a turbulent boundary layer

304
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,370
dimples are very shallow compared to the

305
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,780
diameter of the golf ball but they have

306
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,000
a pretty massive effect what sort of

307
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,740
effect are we talking looking at the

308
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,480
drag right what we call a drag

309
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,150
coefficient you see a really big drop

310
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,090
almost a factor of two when the boundary

311
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,030
layer becomes turbulent so having a

312
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,190
turbulent boundary layer reduces the

313
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,800
size of the turbulent wake but turbulent

314
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,110
wakes themselves are interesting and

315
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,180
scientists are looking for ways to

316
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,540
harness the energy they contain I came

317
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,460
to Caltech to see this experiment where

318
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,080
the water flows around a cylinder and

319
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,150
transitions to turbulence in its wake

320
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,420
the flow is visualized here using a

321
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,150
fluorescent dye you can see how under

322
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,430
the right conditions vortices are shed

323
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,230
by one side of the cylinder and then the

324
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,080
other alternating back and forth in a

325
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,660
regular pattern this is known as

326
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,090
periodic vortex shedding and the pattern

327
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,580
it creates downstream is called a von

328
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,610
Karman vortex street these patterns

329
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,740
appear all over the place most

330
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,530
spectacularly in images taken from space

331
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,950
at this scale an island acts as the

332
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,780
obstacle that creates the periodic

333
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,270
vortex shedding and the vortex street is

334
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,150
made visible by patterns in the clouds

335
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,220
these patterns can even be seen from

336
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,280
ground level obviously this phenomenon

337
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,320
is not strictly turbulent because it

338
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,630
follows a predictable pattern but it is

339
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,170
part of the transition to turbulence and

340
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,610
these scientists are looking for ways to

341
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,440
harness the energy in these vortex

342
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,050
structures one experiment showed that if

343
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,390
you put a dead fish in the wake of an

344
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,529
object it will actually

345
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:49,819
swim upstream this suggests fish can

346
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:51,829
take advantage of turbulent water to

347
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:54,860
swim more efficiently it's just one way

348
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,079
that animals have adapted to live in a

349
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:00,319
turbulent world so to sum up turbulence

350
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:02,990
is everywhere it's inside you around you

351
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,999
from the smallest scales up to the

352
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:07,040
largest structures in the universe and

353
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,100
it's useful for flying airplanes forming

354
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,259
raindrops making golf balls fly further

355
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:14,809
and helping fish dead or alive swim

356
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:15,589
upstream

357
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:19,240
in contrast laminar flow is small

358
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,490
superficial it's a toy that's why it's

359
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,290
most notable use is in decorative

360
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,749
fountains it appeals to your desire for

361
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:30,410
order but the world like turbulence is

362
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:34,240
messy that's why I personally prefer the

363
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,009
richness the unpredictability of

364
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:40,399
turbulent flow no but but turbulent flow

365
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,230
has its places too I'm actually like

366
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,009
studying turbulent flow for like my my

367
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:47,959
schooling like I'm studying turbulent

368
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:50,689
flow in rocket nozzles that's a thing so

369
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:52,220
cheating on laminar flows what are you

370
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,529
doing um no yes yes maybe I don't know

371
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:00,139
but I what you will not get me to say

372
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:02,240
turbulent flow is not awesome and not

373
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,920
beautiful you will not get me to say

374
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,139
that so I will concede and I agree with

375
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:08,990
you turbulent flow is awesome I will

376
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,389
agree all right all right well it's just

377
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:13,339
not as awesome as laminar flow let's be

378
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:19,939
honest hey I just wanted to let you know

379
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:22,220
that this video was filmed before the

380
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,930
kovat outbreak and before the

381
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,579
shelter-in-place guidance was put into

382
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:27,800
effect now this portion of the video was

383
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,809
sponsored by Cottonelle flushable wipes

384
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:31,759
and since the outbreak they have been

385
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,050
working around the clock to get their

386
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,079
products back on shelves and back when I

387
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,250
filmed this video I actually did a

388
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,779
little experiment with these wipes to

389
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:40,670
find out how flushable they really are

390
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,240
so let's check that out so here I have a

391
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,120
baby wipe a paper towel and a cotton L

392
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,399
flushable wipe and I'm gonna submerge

393
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,129
all three of these in the fish tank for

394
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:55,009
30 minutes and then test how strong they

395
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:57,649
are flushable wipes actually became

396
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:58,860
really important to me

397
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,680
a couple years ago when the main sewer

398
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,290
for my building backed up into my condo

399
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,020
and flooded the entire downstairs and

400
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,960
the reason was my neighbor was flushing

401
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,119
baby wipes down the toilet and that

402
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,520
blocked up the whole system so it was

403
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,720
pretty awful but in fact this is the

404
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,450
thing people do a lot there was this

405
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,520
study from 2016 that found in the u.s.

406
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,069
60 million baby wipes are purchased

407
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:25,230
every year and seven million of them end

408
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,720
up being flushed down the toilet in fact

409
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,920
when they looked in the New York City

410
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,990
sewer system they found that 38 percent

411
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,840
of the stuff you find in there is

412
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,960
actually these baby wipes meanwhile 14

413
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,120
million flushable wipes are purchased

414
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,890
every year and flushed down a toilet but

415
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,260
they make up only 2% of what you find in

416
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,570
the sewer system so I think it's so

417
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,040
important that whatever you throw in the

418
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,500
toilet has to be able to break apart so

419
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,750
it doesn't clog everything up okay 30

420
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,150
minutes have elapsed and it is time to

421
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,250
test the strength of these three wipes

422
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,560
so I'm gonna test their strength with a

423
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,320
roll of pennies here we go on the baby

424
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,100
wipe it can still support that wait what

425
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,500
about the paper towel can still support

426
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,090
that wait what about the cut now

427
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:14,340
flushable wipe ah it fell through so

428
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,350
this is what makes the Cottonelle

429
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,960
flushable wipe flushable it immediately

430
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,870
starts to break down after flushing so

431
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,210
you should purchase some cotton nail

432
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,740
flushable wipes and try them out for

433
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,690
yourself want to thank cotton al for

434
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,460
sponsoring this video and I want to

435
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,690
thank you for watching
