the first piece of evidence that showed

our universe is expanding

came in the light from distant galaxies

if you look at the spectrum of the sun

you see these dark lines and we see

those same lines

in the spectra from galaxies except

they're shifted

to longer wavelengths towards the red

end of the spectrum

so we say their light is red-shifted

now the usual explanation for this

redshift is that as the light is

traveling through expanding space

the photons themselves become stretched

so short wavelengths get longer and this

is known as cosmological redshift the

explanation is fairly intuitively

satisfying and most people go on without

giving it a second thought

but the problem is if you do give it a

second thought you think

well if expanding space can stretch

something like a photon something that's

so incredibly tiny does it also stretch

atoms and molecules is expanding

space stretching stars and galaxies

and what about you are you expanding

with the universe

to answer these questions we've got to

take a closer look at what it really

means to

redshift physicists actually talk about

three different types of redshift

doppler redshift where observers moving

relative to one another

measure photons to have different

wavelengths gravitational redshift where

observers at different locations in a

gravitational field

measure different wavelengths and

cosmological redshift where observers

exchanging photons over

vast cosmological distances in an

expanding universe

measure different wavelengths these

three cases

appear very different and they're

governed by different equations

so how does each redshift actually occur

let's start with a photon in a

gravitational field

there is this famous experiment

conducted in 1959 by pound and rebka

sending photons up and down a 22 meter

tower at harvard

now they used gamma rays but all

represent them with visible light

they found that photons detected at the

top of the tower

were redshifted relative to the source

by the exact amount

predicted by general relativity which

is a tiny amount i'm dramatically

exaggerating the effect just so you can

see it

now where along the photons path does

this redshift take place

well it seems to happen continuously the

photon loses

a little bit of energy each millimeter

it climbs

up that tower meaning that the photon in

the middle of the tower

would appear green now according to

einstein's equivalence principle

being at rest on earth's surface is

indistinguishable from being

in a rocket in deep space accelerating

up at one

g so we could do the same experiment

in a rocket ship and we should get the

same result

if we send blue photons from the back of

the rocket

they should be red when they reach the

front and in the middle of the ship they

would appear

green this is exactly what we saw at

rest in a gravitational field so

the equivalence principle holds now

imagine

there are a line of external observers

just

hanging out in space at rest relative to

each other

and they can all see into the rocket

let's also say the rocket is initially

at rest

and the thrusters are switched on the

instant the photon

is released now since both observers are

at rest at this moment

they will both measure the photon as

having the exact same wavelength

it's blue but what about when the photon

reaches the middle of the rocket

well we know someone inside will see it

as green

but what about a stationary observer

outside

well to them the photon has just been

moving through ordinary flat

space-time so it must look blue

just as blue as it was when it was

emitted

so what's the deal how can the same

photon

look green and blue at the same time

has the equivalence principle been

violated the answer

is no it matters a lot to this

measurement

who is doing the observation consider

this

after the photon is emitted the rocket

accelerates it's

speeding up so by the time the photon

reaches the middle of the rocket

everyone inside is now moving at high

velocity

relative to the source when the light

was emitted and relative to the

observers outside the rocket

so it makes sense that the photon as

measured inside will look different

it'll be

redshifted this is the doppler redshift

because

the observer in the middle of the ship

is moving very quickly away from the

source

by the time the photon makes it to the

top of the rocket well the rocket will

be going even

faster and this is why it appears red

but to a stationary observer outside

well it still

looks blue this thought experiment

shows us that wavelength and energy are

not intrinsic properties

of photons they are properties of the

photon observer system

now let's recreate the harvard tower

experiment

observers in the building see the photon

redshifted as it climbs

but here's a question for you what would

a free-falling observer

see well they would be just like

the stationary observers in space

watching the rocket accelerate up

the physics of these two situations are

identical so

they would measure no redshift to them

the photon would look blue the whole

time

what i want to show is that there aren't

actually three different types of

redshifts there is

only one we've seen that the

gravitational redshift can

equivalently be seen as a doppler red

shift when we do the same analysis

in an accelerating rocket ship so what

about

cosmological redshift well for this we

have to zoom

way out past our solar system

the milky way galaxy our local cluster

of galaxies

we want to zoom so far out that the

galaxies in the observable universe

are like molecules in a fluid the

cosmic fluid at this scale we can treat

the whole universe as being

smooth and uniform cosmologists say it

is homogeneous

and just as you don't notice the

individual molecules in a cup of water

at this scale we don't notice the

individual galaxies in the cosmic fluid

and the cosmic fluid looks the same in

every direction

there is no preferred orientation it's

said to be

isotropic now what you'll notice is that

the cosmic fluid is

spreading out it doesn't matter where

you look

you see the same thing things moving

apart

the density of the cosmic fluid is

decreasing

over time and this is the basic property

of an expanding universe

we can draw some coordinates on the

universe we could pick

any different coordinate system we like

but one way it's often done

is to make a coordinate system that

expands with the cosmic fluid

so there will be certain observers whose

coordinates

don't change over time and these are

known as

co-moving observers they are at rest

with respect to the cosmic fluid

by the way on earth we are not a

co-moving observer our galaxy is moving

at 600 kilometers per second

relative to the cosmic microwave

background radiation

now let's pick two co-moving observers a

large distance apart

and have them exchange a photon its

wavelength will be stretched by the

amount the universe has expanded

during the photons journey this is the

standard picture of cosmological

redshift

but now consider a bunch of other

co-moving observers along the path of

this photon

each one absorbs the photon and

instantaneously emits another

identical to the one they measured now

each successive observer

will measure a slightly longer

wavelength than the observer before them

the photons stretching out just as you'd

expect in an expanding universe

but the reason they would give for this

redshift would be different

to each observer their neighboring

co-moving observers

would appear to be moving away from them

in locally flat space time

so they would attribute the increase in

wavelength to the doppler shift

just due to the relative motion between

them the

entirety of the cosmological redshift

then

can equivalently be thought of as the

result of a long

series of doppler shifts

what we've seen is redshifting is not

something that happens to a photon

itself instead it depends on what's

happening to observers at the point of

emission

and absorption of that photon and

because of this

there are actually not three different

types of redshift there's only one

described by a single underlying

mathematical framework

they only look different depending on

your frame of reference

now it can be convenient to talk about

expanding space when you have

two co-moving observers exchanging a

photon over vast distances in

an expanding universe then the photon's

wavelength is just

stretched by the amount the universe

expanded during its journey

that's nice and simple but you can

equally well describe the redshift by

a long chain of doppler shifts no

expanding space required

[Music]

the misconception is to think that

because photons are red-shifted as they

travel across the universe

that means expanding space is pulling on

things

and stretching things apart that's not

how it works space

is not like that so let's come back to

the central question of this video which

is

do you expand with the universe the

answer

is no because on the scale of people

the universe is not homogeneous i mean

matter is condensed down into objects in

the earth

and the universe is not isotropic

looking up looks decidedly different

from

looking down the basic assumptions we

made

about our expanding universe just don't

apply here

i mean the local space-time curvature is

dominated by

the earth so what if we took you out

into deep space

the middle of nowhere then would you

expand

still no because your body is held

together by

electromagnetic forces but what if we

could turn off

the electromagnetic force so your body

is just a jumble of particles that don't

interact

well in that case over time you

would expand but only because our

universe is now dominated by dark energy

so the take-home message of this video

is that red-shifting photons don't mean

that space is expanding and pulling on

everything stretching things apart

so molecules are not expanding and

neither are stars

and neither are galaxies and neither are

you

except for very extraordinary

circumstances

that tells you it's recording here we go
