what's the connection between a dripping

faucet the Mandelbrot set a population

of rabbits thermal convection in a fluid

and the firing of neurons in your brain

it's this one simple equation this video

is sponsored by fast hosts who are

offering UK viewers the chance to win a

trip to South by Southwest if they can

answer my question at the end of this

video so stay tuned for that let's say

you want to model a population of

rabbits if you have X rabbits this year

how many rabbits will you have next year

well the simplest model I can imagine is

where we just multiplied by some number

the growth rate R which could be say 2

and this would mean the population would

double every year and the problem with

that is it means the number of rabbits

would grow exponentially forever

so I can add the term 1 minus X to

represent the constraints of the

environment and here I'm imagining the

population X is a percentage of the

theoretical maximum so it goes from 0 to

1 and as it approaches that maximum then

this term goes to 0 and that constrains

the population so this is the logistic

map xn plus 1 is the population next

year and xn is the population this year

and if you graph the population next

year versus the population this year you

see it is just an inverted parabola it's

the simplest equation you can make that

has a negative feedback loop the bigger

the population gets over here the

smaller it'll be the following year so

let's try an example let's say we're

dealing with a particularly active group

of rabbits so R equals two point six and

then let's pick a starting population of

40% of the maximum so point four and

then times 1 minus 0.4 and we get 0.62

four okay so the population increased in

the first year but what we're really

interested in is the long term behavior

of this population so we can put this

population back into the equation and to

speed things up you can actually type

two point six times answer times one -

answer get point six one so the

population dropped a little hit it again

point six one nine point six one three

point six one seven point six one five

point six one six point six one five and

if I keep hitting Enter here you see

that the population doesn't really

change it has stabilized which matches

what we see in the wild populations

often remain the same as long as births

and deaths are balanced now I want to

make a graph of this iteration you can

see here that it's reached an

equilibrium value of point six one five

now what would happen if I change the

initial population I'm just going to

move this slider here and what you see

is the first few years change but the

equilibrium population remains the same

so we can basically ignore the initial

population so what I'm really interested

in is how does this equilibrium

population vary depending on are the

growth rate so as you can see if I lower

the growth rate the equilibrium

population decreases that makes sense

and in fact if R goes below one well

then the population drops and eventually

goes extinct so what I want to do is

make another graph where on the x axis I

have R the growth rate and on the y axis

I'm plotting the equilibrium population

the population you get after many many

many generations okay for low values of

R we see the populations always go

extinct so the equilibrium value is zero

but once our hits 1 the population

stabilizes on to a constant value and

the higher R is the higher the

equilibrium population

so far so good but now comes the weird

part

once our passes three the graph splits

in two why what's happening well no

matter how many times you iterate the

equation it never settles on to a single

constant value instead it oscillates

back and forth between two values one

year the population is higher the next

year lower and then the cycle repeats

the cyclic nature of populations is

observed in nature too one year there

might be more rabbits and then fewer the

next year and more again the year after

as our continues to increase the fork

spreads apart and then each one splits

again

now instead of oscillating back and

forth between two values populations go

through a four year cycle before

repeating since the length of the cycle

or period has doubled these are known as

period doubling bifurcation z' and as R

increases further there are more period

doubling bifurcation z' they come faster

and faster leading to cycles of 8 16 32

64 and then at R equals three point five

seven chaos the population never settles

down at all it bounces around as if at

random in fact this equation provided

one of the first methods of generating

random numbers on computers it was a way

to get something unpredictable from a

deterministic machine there is no

pattern here no repeating of course if

you did know the exact initial

conditions you could calculate the

values exactly so they are considered

only pseudo-random numbers now you might

expect the equation to be chaotic from

here on out but as R increases order

returns there are these windows of

stable periodic behavior amid the chaos

for example at R equals 3 point 8 3

there is a stable cycle with a period of

3 years and as R continues to increase

it splits into 6 12 24 and so on before

returning to chaos in fact this one

equation contains periods of every

length 3750 1052 whatever you like if

you just have the right value

are looking at this bifurcation diagram

you may notice that it looks like a

fractal the large-scale features look to

be repeated on smaller and smaller

scales and sure enough if you zoom in

you see that it is in fact a fractal

arguably the most famous fractal is the

Mandelbrot set the plot twist here is

that the bifurcation diagram is actually

part of the Mandelbrot set how does that

work well quick recap on the Mandelbrot

set it is based on this iterated

equation so the way it works is you pick

a number C any number in the complex

plane and then start with Z equals 0 and

then iterate this equation over and over

again if it blows up to infinity well

then the number C is not part of the set

but if this number remains finite after

unlimited iterations well then it is

part of the Mandelbrot set so let's try

for example C equals 1 so we've got 0

squared plus 1 equals 1 then 1 squared

plus 1 equals 2 2 squared plus 1 equals

5 5 squared plus 1 equals 26 so pretty

quickly you can see that with C equals 1

this equation is going to blow up so the

number 1 is not part of the Mandelbrot

set what if we try C equals negative 1

well then we've got 0 squared minus 1

equals negative 1 negative 1 squared

minus 1 equals 0 and so we're back to 0

squared minus 1 equals negative 1 so we

see that this function is going to keep

oscillating back and forth between

negative 1 and 0 and so it'll remain

finite and so C equals negative 1 is

part of the Mandelbrot set now normally

when you see pictures of the Mandelbrot

set it just shows you the boundary

between the numbers that cause this

iterated equation to remain finite and

those that cause it to blow up but it

doesn't really show you how these

numbers stay finite so what we've done

here is actually iterated that equation

thousands of times and then plotted on

the z

axis the value that that iteration

actually takes so if we look from the

side what you'll actually see is the

bifurcation diagram it is part of this

Mandelbrot set so what's really going on

here well what this is showing us is

that all of the numbers in the main

cardioid they end up stabilizing on to a

single constant value but the numbers in

this main bulb will they end up

oscillating back and forth between two

values and in this bulb they end up

oscillating between four values they've

got a period of four and then eight and

then 16 32 and so on and then you hit

the chaotic part the chaotic part of the

bifurcation diagram happens out here on

what's called the needle of the

Mandelbrot set where the Mandelbrot set

gets really thin and you can see this

medallion here that looks like a smaller

version of the entire Mandelbrot set

well that corresponds to the window of

stability in the bifurcation plot with a

period of three now the bifurcation

diagram only exists on the real line

because we only put real numbers into

our equation but all of these bulbs off

of the main cardioid well they also have

periodic cycles of for example 3 or 4 or

5 and so you see these repeated ghostly

images if we look in the z axis

effectively they're oscillating between

these values as well

personally I find this extraordinarily

beautiful but if you're more practically

minded you may be asking but does this

equation actually model populations of

animals and the answer is yes

particularly in the controlled

environment scientists have set up in

labs what I find even more amazing is

how this one simple equation applies to

a huge range of totally unrelated areas

of science the first major experimental

confirmation came from a fluid

dynamicists named Lib Taber he created a

small rectangular box with mercury

inside and he used a small temperature

gradient to induce convection just two

counter-rotating cylinders of fluid

inside his box that's all the box was

large enough for and of course he

couldn't look in and see what the fluid

was doing so he measured the temperature

using a probe in the top and what he saw

was a regular spike a periodic spike in

the temperature that's like when the

logistic equation converges on a single

value but as he increased the

temperature gradient a wobble developed

on those rolling cylinders at half the

original frequency the spikes in

temperature were no longer the same

height instead they went back and forth

between two different heights he had

achieved period two and as he continued

to increase the temperature

he saw period doubling again now he had

four different temperatures before the

cycle repeated and then eight this was a

pretty spectacular confirmation of the

theory in a beautifully crafted

experiment but this was only the

beginning

scientists have studied the response of

our eyes and salamander eyes to

flickering lights and what they find is

a period doubling that once the light

reaches a certain rate of flickering our

eyes only respond to every other flicker

it's amazing in these papers to see the

bifurcation diagram emerge albeit a bit

fuzzy because it comes from real-world

data

in another study scientists gave rabbits

a drug that sent their hearts into

fibrillation

I guess they felt there were too many

rabbits out there I mean if you don't

know what fibrillation is it's where

your heart beats in an incredibly

irregular way and doesn't really pump

any blood so if you don't fix it you die

but what they found was on the path to

fibrillation

they found the period doubling route to

chaos the rabbits started out with a

periodic beat and then it went into a

two cycle two beats close together and

then a four cycle four different beats

before it repeated again and eventually

a periodic behavior now it was really

cool about this study was they monitored

the heart in real time and used chaos

theory to determine when to apply

electrical shocks to the heart to return

it to periodicity and they were able to

do that successfully

so they used chaos to control a heart

and figure out a smarter way to deliver

electric shocks to set it beating

normally again that's pretty amazing and

then there is the issue of the dripping

faucet most of us of course think of

dripping faucets as very regular

periodic objects but a lot of research

has gone into finding that once the flow

rate increases a little bit you get

period doubling so now the drips come

two at a time to tip to tip and

eventually from a dripping faucet you

can get chaotic behavior just by

adjusting the flow rate and you think

like what really is a faucet well

there's constant pressure water and a

constant size aperture and yet what

you're getting is chaotic dripping so

this is a really easy chaotic system you

can experiment with at home go open a

tap just a little bit and see if you can

get a periodic dripping in your house

the bifurcation diagram pops up in so

many different places that it starts to

feel spooky and I want to tell you

something that'll make it seem even

spookier

there was this physicist Mitchell

Feigenbaum who was looking at when the

bifurcations occur he divided the width

of each bifurcation section by the next

one and he found that ratio closed in on

this number four point six six nine

which is now called the Feigenbaum

constant the bifurcations come faster

and faster but in a ratio that

approaches this fixed value and no one

knows where this constant comes from it

doesn't seem to relate to any other

known physical constant so it is itself

a fundamental constant of nature what's

even crazier is that it doesn't have to

be the particular form of the equation I

showed you earlier

any equation that has a single hump if

you iterate it the way that we have so

you could use xn plus 1 equals sine X

for example if you iterate that one

again and again and again you will also

see bifurcations not only that but the

ratio of when those bifurcations occur

will have the same scaling for point six

six nine any single hump function

iterated will give you that fundamental

constant so why is this well it's

referred to as universality because

there seems to be something fundamental

and very Universal about this process

this type of equation and that constant

value in 1976 the biologist Robert May

wrote a paper in nature about this very

equation

it's sparked a revolution and people

looking into this stuff I mean that

papers been cited thousands of times and

in the paper he makes this plea that we

should teach students about this simple

equation because it gives you a new

intuition for ways in which simple

things simple equations

can create very complex behaviors and I

still think that today we don't really

teach this way I mean we teach simple

equations and simple outcomes because

those are the easy things to do and

those are the things that make sense

we're not gonna throw chaos at students

but maybe we should maybe we should

throw at least a little bit which is why

I've been so excited about chaos and I

am so excited about this equation

because you know how did I get to be 37

years old without hearing of the

Feigenbaum constant ever since I read

James Gleeks book chaos I have wanted to

make videos on this topic and now I'm

finally getting around to it and

hopefully I'm doing this topic justice

because I find it incredibly fascinating
