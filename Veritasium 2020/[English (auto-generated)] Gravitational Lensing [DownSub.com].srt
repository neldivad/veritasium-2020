techie test question

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,920
later in the show on may 1st 2015

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,679
a group of scientists predicted that the

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:14,960
following november

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,840
we would see a star go supernova

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,840
billions of light years away

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,560
in a spiral galaxy designated sp1149

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,039
this was the first time anyone had ever

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,320
tried to predict

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,679
a supernova and for good reason they are

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,960
incredibly rare and unpredictable for a

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,880
star larger than eight times the mass of

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,600
our sun

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,680
a supernova marks the end of its life

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,399
cycle running out of fuel in its core

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,440
the star collapses in on itself and then

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,600
in the ensuing crush of matter

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,440
it violently explodes a supernova can be

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,600
as bright as a whole galaxy

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,680
and importantly the light emitted

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,520
follows a predictable pattern

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,840
it glows brightly for weeks and then

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,879
fades down over a period of months

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,240
but supernovae are rare in any galaxy of

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,479
a hundred billion stars or so

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,040
you can expect on average only two per

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,159
century

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,159
so just try picking the star that's

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,119
going to explode

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,119
now we can say how long a given star

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,360
will live based on its mass luminosity

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,720
and color temperature

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,960
these data pinpoint its stage of life in

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,640
a predictable life cycle

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,880
but the estimate of exactly when a large

40
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,159
star will go supernova

41
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,720
has big error bars take the red

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,799
supergiant beetlejuice for example

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,520
in our own milky way galaxy it is a

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,600
great candidate to go supernova

45
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,119
scientists think beetlejuice will

46
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,680
explode any day now in the next few

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,960
hundred thousand years when it does

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,880
it'll be so bright you can see it in the

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,640
daytime

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,159
and it will rival the full moon's

51
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,159
brightness at night

52
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,320
compared to the lifespan of a star a

53
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,520
hundred thousand years

54
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,799
is a brief window of time but for us

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,880
short-lived humans it may as well be

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,159
forever

57
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,360
so you might think it would have been a

58
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,960
tough sell when the scientists who

59
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,399
predicted we'd see a supernova in

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,919
november 2015

61
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,599
asked for time on the hubble space

62
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,200
telescope to take pictures of galaxy

63
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,840
sp1149

64
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,040
but their request was granted

65
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,879
they could image this part of the sky

66
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,120
roughly once a month starting on october

67
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,319
30th

68
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,319
before this the galaxy was too close to

69
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,879
the sun to point hubble at it

70
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,959
in this first image taken at the end of

71
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,920
october there is no supernova

72
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,000
the next image was taken on november

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,200
14th

74
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,560
again no supernova but in the third

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,040
image

76
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,400
taken on december 11th jackpot there's a

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,200
supernova

78
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,879
right where they predicted it would be

79
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,959
and almost exactly when they said it

80
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,480
would happen

81
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,400
so how did they manage to predict a

82
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,680
supernova almost

83
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,640
to the month well the truth is they had

84
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,200
seen

85
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,560
this same exact supernova before

86
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,080
not once not twice but four additional

87
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,959
times a year earlier and five months

88
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,080
before the predictions

89
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,640
hubble took this image see those four

90
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,760
bright dots

91
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,840
those are multiple images of that same

92
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,879
supernova

93
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,959
the reason we see the same supernova in

94
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,319
four different locations

95
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,800
is because there is a lens between us

96
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,640
and the exploding star

97
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,959
not a lens made of glass of course but a

98
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,560
gravitational lens

99
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,720
made of a huge amount of ordinary matter

100
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,879
and dark matter

101
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,200
gravitational lensing tends to magnify

102
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,400
distant sources

103
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,319
and increase their apparent brightness

104
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,879
as rays of light become concentrated

105
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,879
this smears the image of distant

106
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,319
galaxies into arcs

107
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,120
strands and all kinds of weird shapes

108
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,080
and of course

109
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,840
to some distant observer in another

110
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,159
galaxy the light from our own sun and

111
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,439
milky way galaxy may be similarly warped

112
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,439
in gravitational lensing there are three

113
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,879
essential components

114
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,239
the source the lens and the telescope

115
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,680
if the lens and the source are

116
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,319
spherically symmetric and if the source

117
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,519
lens and telescope

118
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,760
are perfectly aligned you get what's

119
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,560
known as an

120
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,080
einstein ring the light from the source

121
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,000
is bent around the lens equally

122
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,160
in all directions leading to the image

123
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,040
of a smeared out ring

124
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,238
if the source and the lens are

125
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,240
spherically symmetric but are not

126
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,080
perfectly aligned then what we end up

127
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,280
seeing is a break

128
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,919
in the einstein ring it splits into two

129
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,360
semi-circles

130
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,520
and if the source lens and telescope are

131
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,199
aligned but the lens is not

132
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,600
axially symmetric for example it could

133
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,520
have an elliptical shape

134
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
well then you get four images in the

135
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,040
shape of a cross

136
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,800
an einstein cross so what happened with

137
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,919
our supernova

138
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,960
is 9.3 billion years ago

139
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,520
a dying star in a galaxy far far away

140
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,040
went out with a bang

141
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,000
as a supernova the explosion sent out a

142
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,240
blast of light in all directions

143
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,560
about five billion years ago before the

144
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,919
earth even existed

145
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,320
that light encountered a very massive

146
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,600
object that warped

147
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,720
space-time it was a cluster of galaxies

148
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,360
called

149
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,919
macs j1149.5 plus

150
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,400
2223 yeah i know that's a mouthful but

151
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
the name just tells us where in the sky

152
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,639
it was discovered by the massive cluster

153
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,800
survey

154
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,199
this galaxy cluster is made up of lots

155
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,039
of massive substructures like

156
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,360
individual galaxies and halos of dark

157
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,240
matter

158
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,080
at some point as the light traveled

159
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,160
through this region it encountered an

160
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,600
elliptical galaxy

161
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,840
almost perfectly lined up with where the

162
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,919
earth would eventually be

163
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,400
and the gravitational deflection focused

164
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,880
light rays that were initially diverging

165
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,080
onto paths that converged at the earth

166
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,479
this is why we saw the same supernova in

167
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,440
four different locations

168
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,199
not only did the supernova appear at

169
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,520
four different places the images also

170
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,000
appeared at different times

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,919
relative to the first image the others

172
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,919
were delayed by periods ranging from

173
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:04,960
five days to

174
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,199
over three weeks and we could measure

175
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,479
this time delay because of the

176
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,840
distinctive light curve

177
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,240
of the supernova some of the images of

178
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,840
the explosion were further along in

179
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,319
their light curve than others

180
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,800
this was a particularly lucky discovery

181
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
it's the first time a multiply lensed

182
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,120
supernova has ever been observed

183
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,800
there are other objects that due to

184
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,400
gravitational lensing appear multiple

185
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,919
times on the sky like

186
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,479
multiple images of galaxies but these

187
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,319
objects don't change predictably with

188
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:32,720
time

189
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,639
so there's no way to use their images to

190
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,560
work out the relative time delay between

191
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,560
them

192
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,319
now one reason for the time delay

193
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,919
between the supernova images

194
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,240
is because the four paths the light took

195
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,600
were different lengths

196
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,440
so it just took the light longer to

197
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,800
travel further

198
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,280
but there is another reason which is

199
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,039
that light passing through curved

200
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,000
space-time

201
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,560
appears to travel more slowly relative

202
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,720
to an external observer

203
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,199
this is much less intuitive but it's a

204
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,000
well-established

205
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,840
and well-tested part of general

206
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,479
relativity back in 1964

207
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,319
irwin shapiro suggested it would be

208
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,639
possible to test this gravitational time

209
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,199
delay

210
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,599
by sending radar signals to venus and

211
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,440
measuring how long it takes for the echo

212
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,639
to come back

213
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,160
he calculated that due to the

214
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,080
gravitational influence of the sun

215
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,160
the signals would take an extra 200

216
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,120
microseconds

217
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,960
when venus was on the other side of the

218
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,639
sun compared to when it was close to us

219
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,800
this is solely a gravitational time

220
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,880
delay not related to the extra distance

221
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,479
the light has to travel

222
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,639
and within a couple years experimental

223
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,759
data revealed

224
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,680
the gravitational time delay for light

225
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,199
traveling past the sun

226
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,639
was exactly as predicted today

227
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,319
in order to accurately determine the

228
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,080
distance to the voyager and pioneer

229
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,039
spacecraft

230
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,280
this shapiro time delay must be taken

231
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,879
into account

232
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,319
now i want you to have a look at the

233
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,400
four supernova images again

234
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
do you notice how the same galaxy

235
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,759
appears three times

236
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,560
in this image that is the supernova's

237
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,080
host galaxy

238
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,800
it is itself lensed by the massive

239
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,960
galaxy cluster nacs j1149.5 plus

240
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,160
two two three in fact this cluster

241
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,199
lenses tens of galaxies so scientists

242
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,560
had been studying and

243
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,240
modeling the distribution of matter in

244
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,039
the cluster long before the supernova

245
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,520
they asked if we see these four images

246
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,960
of the supernova in one

247
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,280
image of its host galaxy when would the

248
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,800
supernova appear in these

249
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,760
other two images of the host galaxy and

250
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,679
using the models of mass distribution

251
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:35,919
and

252
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,320
general relativity they calculated that

253
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,200
in this image

254
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,599
the supernova would have appeared 20

255
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,039
years earlier

256
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,320
in 1995. now there are no close-up

257
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,760
pictures of this part of the sky from

258
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,519
1995 so

259
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,839
there is no way to check but in the

260
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,440
other image of the galaxy

261
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,800
they predicted the supernova would

262
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,480
appear again in about

263
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,519
one year's time almost exactly

264
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,959
when it showed up in that hubble image

265
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,959
this successful prediction is a

266
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,399
fantastic confirmation of our

267
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,160
understanding of light and gravity

268
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,560
on the scale of the whole universe but

269
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,000
it has even bigger

270
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,320
implications one of the hottest debates

271
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,080
in astronomy right now is

272
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,240
how fast is our universe actually

273
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,360
expanding

274
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,600
this is measured by the hubble constant

275
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
the rate at which distant galaxies are

276
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,040
receding away from each other

277
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,160
depending on their distance apart now

278
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,000
there are two main ways this measurement

279
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,680
has traditionally been made

280
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,920
one is to look for stars in the nearby

281
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,800
universe

282
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,920
whose absolute luminosity we know then

283
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,160
we can use how bright they appear to us

284
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,640
to determine how far away they are if

285
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,399
you combine this distance information

286
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,240
with how red-shifted their light is

287
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,399
you can work out how fast the universe

288
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,600
is expanding

289
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,680
this is known as the distance ladder

290
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
method and the value of the hubble

291
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,959
constant it produces

292
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,680
is around 74 kilometers per second per

293
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,800
megaparsec

294
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,959
meaning for every megaparsec that

295
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,560
separates two galaxies

296
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,959
they will on average be moving apart at

297
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,680
74 kilometers per second

298
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,040
the other way to measure the hubble

299
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,200
constant is to study the features

300
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,120
in the cosmic microwave background

301
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,560
radiation which is

302
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,399
essentially just a picture of the early

303
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,800
universe using the standard model of

304
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,680
cosmology which is called lambda cdm

305
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,600
we can work out how this early universe

306
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,079
picture would expand over time

307
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,920
the result obtained from this method

308
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,320
comes out to 67 kilometers per second

309
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,600
per megaparsec

310
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,079
substantially slower than the 74 found

311
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,680
via the other method

312
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,279
now over the years both of these

313
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,800
techniques have been refined

314
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,120
reducing their uncertainties but the

315
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,000
values

316
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,560
have not gotten closer together so at

317
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,440
this moment

318
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,320
the two values really seem different

319
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,800
they are

320
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,560
on the cusp of being a five sigma result

321
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,040
astrophysicist joseph silk has called it

322
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,920
a possible crisis for cosmology

323
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,360
but there are independent ways to

324
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,279
measure the hubble constant and one of

325
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:01,760
them

326
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,680
is to look at a multiply lensed

327
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,160
supernova and use the time delay between

328
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,120
their appearances

329
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,000
to work it out this was first proposed

330
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,920
by a norwegian astronomer sierra

331
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,480
refstall in 1964.

332
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,160
since this is the first observed

333
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,399
multiply lensed supernova it has become

334
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,040
known as

335
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,760
supernova ref stall calculations of the

336
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,519
hubble constant from this data

337
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,160
yield a value of 64 kilometers per

338
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,600
second per megaparsec

339
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
now although that result has large error

340
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,360
bars it is more in line with the

341
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,800
measurements of the cosmic microwave

342
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,399
background radiation than with the

343
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,320
distance ladder method

344
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,480
the thing i keep thinking about is how

345
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,360
strange

346
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,760
space is i mean i used to think of it

347
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,200
essentially like glass

348
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,440
fundamentally transparent with some

349
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,160
foggy regions or some slight distortions

350
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,639
but here we have space warping light on

351
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,279
multiple

352
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,440
curved trajectories making the same

353
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,480
event appear

354
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,120
in six different places on the sky

355
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,240
separated by

356
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,480
days weeks a year and 20 years

357
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,240
and what is contained in those

358
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,480
distortions is information about the

359
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,279
workings

360
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,839
of our entire universe

now on to my techie test question

388
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,639
which famous scientist criticized

389
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,200
newtonian gravity by saying

390
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,839
that gravity should be innate inherent

391
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,440
and essential to matter

392
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,839
so that one body may act upon another at

393
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:14,800
a distance through

394
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,959
a vacuum without the mediation of

395
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,399
anything else

396
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,600
is to me so great an absurdity that i

397
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,000
believe

398
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,560
no man who has in philosophical matters

399
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,240
a competent faculty of thinking

400
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,279
can ever fall into it if you know the

401
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,560
