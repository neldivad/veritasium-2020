00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,240
during the covid lockdown this headline

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,439
went viral

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,680
nearly half of men say they do most of

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,040
the homeschooling

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,000
three percent of women agree i bring

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,320
this

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,799
up not to debate who's right but because

8
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,400
it's a great example of something called

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,520
egocentric bias most people think they

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,160
do

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,039
most of the work for example researchers

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,400
have asked authors of

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,720
multi-author papers what percentage of

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,720
the work they personally did

15
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,480
and when they add up those percentages

16
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,079
the sum is on average 140 percent

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,760
when couples are asked to estimate how

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,200
much of the housework they do the

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
combined total is almost always

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,840
over a hundred percent now you might

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,200
think this is because people want to

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,840
appear

23
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,399
more helpful than they actually are but

24
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,680
that's not it

25
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,120
when couples are asked what fraction of

26
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,960
the fights they start or how much of the

27
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,000
mess is theirs

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,960
the total is again over a hundred people

29
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,399
think they do more of the work

30
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,000
but they also think they cause more of

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,480
the problems so why is this

32
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,000
i think it's simply because you

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
experience and remember vividly all of

34
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,120
what you do

35
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,199
but not all of what everyone else does

36
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,200
so naturally you overestimate your own

37
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,240
contributions and

38
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,799
underestimate others and i think this

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,360
bias

40
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,280
leads us to underestimate the influence

41
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,200
of other things on our lives like

42
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,320
the role luck plays in our success take

43
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,840
hockey players for example

44
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,439
if you ask a professional hockey player

45
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,280
how they managed to reach the nhl

46
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,720
they might mention their hard work

47
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,320
determination great coaches their

48
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,240
parents willingness to get up at 5am and

49
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,960
so on

50
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,799
but they probably won't acknowledge how

51
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,159
lucky they were to be born

52
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,360
in january and yet in many years 40

53
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,200
of hockey players selected into top tier

54
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,040
leagues are born in the first quarter of

55
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,600
the year

56
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,439
compared to just 10 percent in the

57
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,720
fourth quarter an

58
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
early birthday can make you up to four

59
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,880
times as likely to be a pro hockey

60
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,520
player

61
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,040
and the reason for this disparity is

62
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,200
presumably because the cutoff date for

63
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,600
kids hockey leagues is january 1st

64
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,040
those born in the first part of the year

65
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,799
are a little older and so on average

66
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,560
bigger and faster than kids in their

67
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,280
league born

68
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,680
late in the year now as they grow up

69
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,360
this difference should eventually shrink

70
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,240
to nothing

71
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,640
but it doesn't because the young kids

72
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,080
who share the most promise are given

73
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,598
more time on the ice and enter more

74
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,120
tournaments where they receive better

75
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
coaching and improve their skills

76
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,520
and these advantages compound year after

77
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,599
year so by the time you get to the pros

78
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,520
birthdays are heavily skewed towards the

79
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,959
start of the year

80
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,480
but does any professional hockey player

81
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,400
feel thankful for their birthday

82
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,520
probably not and we are all like that

83
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,120
largely oblivious to the fortunate

84
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,280
events that support our success

85
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,040
probably the most significant bit of

86
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,959
luck many of us enjoy is being born into

87
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,400
a prosperous country

88
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,000
around half the variance in income

89
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,519
received by people around the world is

90
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,440
explained by their country of residence

91
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
and that country's income distribution

92
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,120
if you were born in burundi for example

93
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,080
which has the world's

94
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,840
lowest gross national income per capita

95
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,200
of just 730

96
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,440
a year it doesn't matter how smart or

97
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,640
hard-working you are

98
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,200
you're unlikely to earn much as an adult

99
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,720
now many people get offended if you

100
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
point out how big a role chance plays in

101
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,680
their success

102
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,599
and i get it if we are just a product of

103
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,720
our circumstances

104
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,959
then our hard work and our talent seem

105
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,480
to count for nothing

106
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,640
people think it has to be either skill

107
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,519
or luck

108
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,840
that explains success but the truth is

109
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,200
you need both

110
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,959
take these eight track and field world

111
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,040
records all the athletes who achieve

112
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,239
these records are obviously

113
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,239
world class extremely dedicated and

114
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,599
talented and yet

115
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,360
when they achieved their world records

116
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,519
seven out of eight had a tailwind

117
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,280
now these athletes all had the ability

118
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,120
to win a gold medal but to set the world

119
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,680
record

120
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,159
required a bit of luck as well the

121
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,000
importance of luck increases the greater

122
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,280
the number of applicants

123
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,159
applying for just a few spaces consider

124
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,640
the most recent class of nasa astronauts

125
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,959
from over 18 300 applicants in 2017

126
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,200
only 11 were selected and went on to

127
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,879
graduate from the astronaut training

128
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,760
program

129
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,680
now we can make a toy model of the

130
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,280
selection process

131
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,720
let's assume that astronauts are

132
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,799
selected mostly based on skill

133
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,519
experience and hard work but also say

134
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,239
five percent

135
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,920
as a result of luck fortunate

136
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,360
circumstances

137
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,599
for each applicant i randomly generated

138
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,200
a skill score out of a hundred

139
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,360
and i also randomly generated a luck

140
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,959
score out of a hundred

141
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,720
then i added those numbers together

142
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,080
weighted in the 95

143
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,440
to 5 ratio to get an overall score

144
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,680
this score represents the selector's

145
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,918
judgments meaning the top 11 by this

146
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:22,560
metric

147
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,280
would become astronauts and i repeated

148
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
this simulation a thousand times

149
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,080
representing

150
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,680
a thousand different astronaut

151
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,080
selections and what i found was

152
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,560
the astronauts who were picked were very

153
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,199
lucky

154
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,560
they had an average luck score of 94.7

155
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,800
so how many of the selected astronauts

156
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,639
would have been in the top 11 based on

157
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,199
skill

158
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,240
alone the answer was on average only 1.6

159
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,479
that means even with luck accounting for

160
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,759
just 5

161
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,960
of the outcome 9 or maybe 10 of the 11

162
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,240
applicants selected

163
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,400
would have been different if luck played

164
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,560
no role at all

165
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,240
when competition is fierce being

166
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,320
talented and hardworking is important

167
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,639
but it's not enough to guarantee success

168
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,199
you also need to catch a break

169
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,960
largely i think we're unaware of our

170
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,880
good luck because by definition it's not

171
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,160
something we did

172
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,440
like the housework done by your

173
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,400
significant other it goes unappreciated

174
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,479
and here's the crazy thing downplaying

175
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,080
the importance of chance events may

176
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,479
actually

177
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,199
improve your probability of success

178
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:25,840
because

179
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,280
if you perceive an outcome to be

180
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,120
uncertain you're less likely to invest

181
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,720
effort in it which further decreases

182
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,479
your chances of success

183
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,199
so it's a useful delusion to believe you

184
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,360
are in full control of your destiny

185
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,280
i mean if i had known how bad i was when

186
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,120
i started youtube or how much work it

187
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,600
would take

188
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,840
i might have given up right then welcome

189
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,360
to veritasium

190
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,080
an online science video blog now there

191
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,919
may be another benefit to overlooking

192
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,520
your lucky breaks which is

193
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,680
it makes it easier to justify your place

194
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,639
in society

195
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,560
if you have a lot of wealth or power you

196
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,919
can just chalk it up to your own

197
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,319
intelligence effort and perseverance it

198
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,199
makes it easier to accept inequality

199
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,960
in one experiment participants were put

200
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,280
in groups of three in small rooms to

201
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,759
discuss a complex moral problem and one

202
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,199
person in each group was randomly

203
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,360
designated the team leader

204
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,280
half an hour later the experimenter came

205
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,520
by with four cookies for each team

206
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,240
so who got the extra cookie in each case

207
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,759
it went to the team leader

208
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,759
even though they had no special aptitude

209
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,520
they didn't have extra responsibilities

210
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,039
and they'd gotten their position through

211
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,400
chance alone

212
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
once you have achieved a certain status

213
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,840
it seems natural to feel like you

214
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,960
deserve it and

215
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,560
all the other good things that come your

216
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,800
way now this is just an anecdote but

217
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,319
whenever i've been upgraded to fly a

218
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,120
business class

219
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,440
i've always observed the worst behavior

220
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,520
in my fellow privileged passengers they

221
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,639
just act so entitled and uncourteous and

222
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,479
research has found evidence for this as

223
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,800
well in another experiment participants

224
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,240
were asked to think of a good thing that

225
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,919
happened to them recently

226
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,440
and then one group was asked to list

227
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,280
their own personal qualities or actions

228
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,880
that made that good thing happen

229
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,560
another group was asked to list external

230
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,080
factors beyond their control

231
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,000
that led to the event and a control

232
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,520
group was simply asked to list reasons

233
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,960
why the good thing happened

234
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,240
now for completing this task

235
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,520
participants were told they would be

236
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,560
paid a dollar

237
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,080
but at the end they were offered the

238
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,680
option to donate some or

239
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,080
all of the money to a charity results

240
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,840
showed those who listed their own

241
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,599
personal attributes contributed

242
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,400
25 less than those who listed external

243
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,479
factors beyond their control

244
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,240
now think of what all this means for

245
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,080
people in our society specifically for

246
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,840
people in positions of power like

247
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
business leaders and politicians now

248
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,360
undoubtedly most of them

249
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,520
are talented and hardworking but they

250
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,759
have also been luckier than most

251
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,840
and like most of us they don't realize

252
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,599
just how lucky they are

253
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,520
and this gives them a distorted view of

254
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,199
reality they're kind of

255
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,080
living in a form of survivor bias all

256
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,520
these leaders have worked hard and

257
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,960
ultimately succeeded so

258
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,360
to them the world appears fair in their

259
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
experience it rewards hard work

260
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,879
but what they don't have is the

261
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,240
experience of all the people who have

262
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,879
worked hard

263
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,520
and failed so what are they to make of

264
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,280
people less successful than themselves

265
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,879
well the natural conclusion is that

266
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,879
they must just be less talented or less

267
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,080
hard-working

268
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,599
and this perspective makes them less

269
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,160
inclined to be generous to give back

270
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,759
and they are the ones who set the rules

271
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,840
for how society operates

272
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,599
and this is particularly unfortunate

273
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,360
since one of the main ways many of us

274
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,000
are lucky

275
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,479
is in our country of residence but what

276
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,440
is a country

277
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,879
except for the things put there by

278
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,560
people who came before the

279
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,479
roads and the schools public transport

280
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,639
emergency services clean air and water

281
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,120
everything like that it seems a cruel

282
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,958
trick of our psychology that

283
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,799
successful people without any malice

284
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,479
will credit their success largely to

285
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:38,880
their

286
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,479
own hard work and ingenuity and

287
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,559
therefore contribute less to maintaining

288
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,200
the very

289
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,959
circumstances that made that success

290
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,800
possible in the first place

291
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,880
the good news is that acknowledging our

292
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,240
fortunate circumstances

293
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,160
not only brings us more in line with

294
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,720
reality it also makes us more likeable

295
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,480
in a study where people had to read the

296
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,240
transcript of a fictional 60 minutes

297
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,080
interview with a biotech entrepreneur

298
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,760
experimenters tried changing just the

299
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,680
last paragraph where the interviewee

300
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,959
is talking about the reasons for their

301
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,440
company's success in one version the

302
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,000
entrepreneur

303
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,760
personally takes credit for the success

304
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,600
they've had but in the other

305
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,240
he says luck played a significant role

306
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,920
now people who read the luck version of

307
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,640
the transcript

308
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,480
judged the entrepreneur as kinder and

309
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,600
thought they'd be more likely to be

310
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,040
close friends with him than those who

311
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,519
read the other version of the transcript

312
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,760
and raising our awareness of fortunate

313
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,680
events can also make us happier

314
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,480
because it allows us to feel gratitude

315
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,240
personally i am grateful to michael

316
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,480
stevens of vsauce who on october 7th

317
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,279
2012

318
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,440
posted the video how much does a shadow

319
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,200
weigh which shouts out my slow-motion

320
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,399
slinky drop video

321
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,399
and within three days my subscribers had

322
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,240
increased by a third and within a month

323
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,920
they had doubled leading me to quit my

324
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,760
part-time job and work exclusively on

325
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,880
youtube videos

326
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,320
and i'm grateful to the writer of the

327
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,600
free newspaper they give out on the

328
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,040
trains in sydney who didn't quite

329
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,320
understand electricity

330
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,000
leading me to post this picture of their

331
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,680
article to my instagram with the caption

332
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,519
what's wrong with this picture and i'm

333
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,880
lucky that the first person to answer

334
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,600
correctly

335
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,920
was a beautiful woman who became my

336
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,279
future wife

337
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,399
yep that is how i met your mother

338
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,320
now initially i wanted to make this

339
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,480
video just to say our circumstances and

340
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,560
psychology conspire to make us oblivious

341
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,680
to our own luck

342
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,279
this leads successful people to view the

343
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,440
world as fair and those less successful

344
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,200
than them as less talented or

345
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,440
less hardworking and this is before you

346
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,040
factor in any discrimination or

347
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,160
prejudice

348
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,320
but it also became apparent to me that i

349
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,079
should talk about what to do if you want

350
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,160
to be successful in such a world and i

351
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,360
think the best advice

352
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,560
is paradoxical first you must believe

353
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,480
that you are in complete control of your

354
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,120
destiny

355
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,200
and that your success comes down only to

356
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,440
your own talent and hard work

357
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,000
but second you've got to know that's not

358
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,560
true

359
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,040
for you or anyone else so you have to

360
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,079
remember if you do

361
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,240
achieve success that luck played a

362
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,760
significant role and given your good

363
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,560
fortune

364
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
you should do what you can to increase

365
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,200
the luck of others

366
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,920
hey so i had an idea for what i could do

367
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,440
to increase the luck of others

368
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,279
and that is to give away a hundred

369
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,640
snatims kits to people who couldn't

370
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,000
otherwise afford them

371
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,920
so if you didn't know snatums is a

372
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,519
product that i invented and kickstarted

373
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,079
five years

374
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,120
ago it's a molecular modeling kit where

375
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,399
all the atoms snap together magnetically

376
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,399
now i made it because i really wanted to

377
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,160
tackle the misconception that bonds

378
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,800
store energy they don't it takes energy

379
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,200
to

380
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,959
break them and you can feel that with

381
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,600
snatums recently i completely

382
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,760
retooled snatums so there are small

383
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,200
holes where the magnets are

384
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
this allows them to touch directly

385
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,560
increasing the bonding strength so you

386
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,680
can form bigger

387
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,000
more stable molecules i call these

388
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,800
snatums

389
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,680
x and yes they are backwards compatible

390
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,959
with original snatums

391
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,880
so here's my idea for the next month you

392
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,320
can buy snatums for 10

393
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
off using the code give luck and for

394
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,839
each one sold i will give a kit to

395
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,360
someone who can't afford one

396
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,120
up to a limit of a hundred so i'll put

397
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,320
links and more details in the

398
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,040
description

399
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,560
and i really want to thank you for

400
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,560
watching and thank you for

401
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,600
all my good luck
