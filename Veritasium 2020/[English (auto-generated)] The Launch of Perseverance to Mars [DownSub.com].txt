wow

this is what it's like to be at the

launch of a spacecraft

we have this mission launching the

perseverance rover

and the helicopter ingenuity is going up

on a seven

month uh journey to reach mars this is

just awesome

man my first launch of a spacecraft and

i just feel like i'm the only one out

here it's me and the

spacecraft is right over i don't know

there somewhere i'm gonna put on a long

line so we can see it i think i can see

it

holy crap holy crap

look at it go

that is phenomenal you got any advice

for me in terms of like what i should be

looking out for or

you know any advice for a first-timer so

it's really interesting to me is how

emotional it is

so basically what you're going to see is

is it's almost like a

miracle like you hear it the countdown

and then all of a sudden you see this

light taking off it's like you know it's

like clouds and then you see the light

taking off

and just like well i don't hear anything

all of a sudden you feel it in your body

like that

the sound of course propagating slower

than the light will hit your body and

will really

shake you and you know it's this almost

out of body experience that you're part

of really again

taking off from the shore of the cosmic

ocean

you know so for me it's like you know

punching a hole in the sky

so

that was amazing

and there it is doing its turn to the

east

i felt this for the first time a couple

years ago when i saw

the solar eclipse but there are just

some

moments in life where you realize that

you are really on this

rock hurtling through space the solar

eclipse was one of those moments for me

and

seeing this rocket launch to another

planet

it just hits that home it's like most of

your daily life you can go

and and just do everything without

thinking about that fundamental reality

but when you see something like this

it just changes your world view for a

minute

and so you can really embrace this sense

that we're on this

this rock hurtling through space and we

just sent off a

a projectile to another planet which is

a pretty freaking amazing thing

i know we've done it a number of times

in the past so

you know maybe people get sort of numb

to it but uh

it's in a pretty extraordinary

accomplishment every

every time

you
