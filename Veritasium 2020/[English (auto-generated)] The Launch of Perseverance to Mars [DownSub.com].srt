1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,720
wow

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,799
this is what it's like to be at the

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,120
launch of a spacecraft

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,040
we have this mission launching the

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,480
perseverance rover

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,200
and the helicopter ingenuity is going up

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,920
on a seven

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,119
month uh journey to reach mars this is

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:19,920
just awesome

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,800
man my first launch of a spacecraft and

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,080
i just feel like i'm the only one out

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,920
here it's me and the

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,279
spacecraft is right over i don't know

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,558
there somewhere i'm gonna put on a long

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,559
line so we can see it i think i can see

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,280
it

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,079
holy crap holy crap

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,399
look at it go

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,840
that is phenomenal you got any advice

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,600
for me in terms of like what i should be

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,039
looking out for or

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,760
you know any advice for a first-timer so

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,440
it's really interesting to me is how

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,960
emotional it is

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
so basically what you're going to see is

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
is it's almost like a

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,039
miracle like you hear it the countdown

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,479
and then all of a sudden you see this

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,720
light taking off it's like you know it's

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,560
like clouds and then you see the light

31
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,760
taking off

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,600
and just like well i don't hear anything

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,680
all of a sudden you feel it in your body

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,320
like that

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,240
the sound of course propagating slower

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,320
than the light will hit your body and

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,680
will really

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,320
shake you and you know it's this almost

39
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,479
out of body experience that you're part

40
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,520
of really again

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,479
taking off from the shore of the cosmic

42
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,119
ocean

43
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,560
you know so for me it's like you know

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:41,840
punching a hole in the sky

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
so

46
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,400
that was amazing

47
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,840
and there it is doing its turn to the

48
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
east

49
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,640
i felt this for the first time a couple

50
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,080
years ago when i saw

51
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,879
the solar eclipse but there are just

52
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,680
some

53
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,800
moments in life where you realize that

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,239
you are really on this

55
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,239
rock hurtling through space the solar

56
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,760
eclipse was one of those moments for me

57
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,480
and

58
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,720
seeing this rocket launch to another

59
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,760
planet

60
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,640
it just hits that home it's like most of

61
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,239
your daily life you can go

62
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,239
and and just do everything without

63
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,920
thinking about that fundamental reality

64
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,319
but when you see something like this

65
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,200
it just changes your world view for a

66
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,840
minute

67
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,640
and so you can really embrace this sense

68
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,519
that we're on this

69
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,840
this rock hurtling through space and we

70
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,879
just sent off a

71
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,159
a projectile to another planet which is

72
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,239
a pretty freaking amazing thing

73
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,159
i know we've done it a number of times

74
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,440
in the past so

75
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,360
you know maybe people get sort of numb

76
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,959
to it but uh

77
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,640
it's in a pretty extraordinary

78
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,000
accomplishment every

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,840
every time

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,080
you
