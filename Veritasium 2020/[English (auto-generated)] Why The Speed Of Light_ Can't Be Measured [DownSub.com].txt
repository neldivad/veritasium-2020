about kiwiko at the end of the show

i know what you're thinking clickbait no

one has measured the speed of light

that's ridiculous the speed of light is

exactly 299 million 792

458 meters per second we are so sure of

it that since 1983 we've actually

used the speed of light to define how

long a meter is

it's just the distance light travels in

a vacuum in one over two nine nine

seven nine two 792 458 of a second that

definition

ensures that the speed of light is

exactly

this number no decimals but

hear me out in this video i will prove

to you that light

may never actually travel at this speed

and i can say that because no one has

actually

measured it we can't measure the speed

of light the same way we measure the

speed

of anything else

i think we're recording everywhere what

are we doing this is a video about

measuring the speed of stuff okay tell

me about how you measured the speed

of the baseball fired out of your cannon

well to get the speed of the baseball

you need to know two things you need to

know the distance

between two points and you need to know

the time that it takes the baseball to

travel between those points

so basically we took distance divided by

time and that's the speed of the

baseball

and in our case we were shooting with a

high speed camera so you basically just

count the frames

and then your clock is internal oh

you're going relativity you're gonna do

something weird aren't you

you saw it coming i can't believe it oh

man the thing i want to ask you about

is the speed of light okay could you

measure the speed of light like this

imagine you have a laser that can fire a

beam through

a perfect vacuum for one kilometer start

a timer

the instant you fire the laser beam then

exactly when it hits the end

stop the clock except how do you know

when light reaches one kilometer

if you and the clock are at the starting

point

okay so you need two clocks one at the

laser and one at the end

which stops automatically when it

detects the laser light

but now how do you make sure your two

clocks are synchronized

well you could connect them via a wire

and send a pulse from one to the other

but that pulse will travel at the speed

of light so

it will arrive with a time delay you

might think

you can just subtract that time delay

but is equal to the time it takes for

light to travel one kilometer

that's what we don't know and are trying

to measure

okay new plan start with the clocks

together

and sync them up first and then send one

of the clocks down to the end

now what could possibly go wrong

well i'll tell you the clock at the

finish line was moving with respect to

the one at the start

and special relativity tells us moving

clocks tick slow relative to stationary

observers

so by the time the clock reaches one

kilometer it will no longer be in sync

with the clock at the start

can i tell you the only solution to this

problem

ditch the second clock put a mirror at

the end to reflect the light back

and use a single clock at the start to

time the full two kilometer round trip

wasn't this actually done before he was

on a mountain and there's a wagon wheel

with a lantern

and there's something like a mirror on

the other side of the mountain i've

always wanted to do this

so uh that sounds a little like how the

speed of light was first

experimentally measured by epolite fizzo

in 1849

he shot a beam of light between the

teeth of a rapidly spinning gear to a

mirror

up on a hill eight kilometers away and

then by

increasing the speed of the gear he

reached a point where the reflected

light passed through the next gap on the

gear

and so it was observed so he measured

the speed of light to be

313 000 kilometers per second

which is within five percent of the

presently accepted value

so someone has measured the speed of

light

or have they what has been measured is

the

round trip or two-way speed of light but

no one has measured the one-way

speed of light one thing i'm going to

throw at you and i'm just going to

i'm just going to come out and tell you

it's like what if the speed of light

in this direction is different from the

speed of light in this direction

then that sounds like a veritasium video

the question is could you figure it out

the kind of crux of this problem

is that the only way people have managed

to measure the speed of light

is for a round trip no one's ever

managed to measure the speed of light in

just one direction

it's possible that the speed of light is

half

of c in one direction and then

instantaneous on the return journey

what that's that's possible are you

serious

think about communicating with an

astronaut stranded on mars

let's call him mark we send out a signal

and get a response 20 minutes later

so we imagine our signal takes 10

minutes to get there

and the reply takes 10 minutes to come

back

but it's possible that our message took

all

20 minutes to get there and the reply

came back

instantaneously there's no way we could

tell the difference between these two

scenarios

but why would the speed of light be

different well

it's possible that there is some

preferred direction through space-time

i mean our universe has a lot of

symmetries but there is also some

asymmetry

for example why is there so much matter

relative to antimatter

and physicists have worked out

internally consistent theories of

physics in which the speed of light

is different forwards and in reverse the

speed of light could vary by just a few

percent

up to at the extreme going c over two in

one direction and

infinitely fast in the other direction

okay so let me let me figure this out so

yeah i

i kind of don't believe you i kind of

don't believe you

i don't believe you that light is a

different speed in one direction but in

the other but i know you well enough to

know that you wouldn't

you wouldn't call me and put a camera

on me unless you knew you were right and

that's what scares me about this

that scares me

now you might think it is just simpler

that light should travel at the same

speed in all directions

but the truth is that is a convention

rather than an experimentally verified

fact

einstein himself pointed this out in his

famous 1905 paper

on the electrodynamics of moving bodies

he spends the first couple of pages

on the problem of synchronizing clocks

at different locations a

and b and he says there is no way that

we can meaningfully compare the times

they measure

unless we establish by definition that

the time required by light to travel

from a to b

equals the time it requires to travel

from b to a

he's essentially defining that the speed

of light in opposite directions

is the same and he puts by definition in

italics to remind us

that this is only a convention it's

known as the einstein synchronization

convention

so the idea that the speed of light is

the same in opposite directions

as einstein would later write is neither

a supposition nor a hypothesis about the

physical nature of light

but a stipulation that i can make of my

own free will to arrive at a definition

of simultaneity

that sounds a lot more subjective than

how i think most people

would imagine the speed of light is

defined dude

this is hardcore

i've never thought about this i didn't

think about this before either i always

assumed that when we said

the speed of light is c we meant the

one-way speed of light there's no way to

define the one-way speed of light

so the only thing we can really define

is the two-way speed of light just

look at the way einstein defines c it's

for the round trip from a

to b and back i don't know if you saw in

your physics classes but whenever there

was a light clock

it would always bounce the light up and

then back you would never see a light

clock just bounce slight one way

and this is why the only thing we can be

certain

is constant for all inertial observers

is the two-way speed of light

for over a hundred years scientists have

tried to find a way around this

to measure the one-way speed of light by

itself

here is a paper published in the

american journal of physics in 2009 that

claims to measure the one-way speed of

light

and here is the paper debunking this

study pointing out that these authors

were actually measuring the two-way

speed of light

but i'm imagining you might have some

ideas for how to measure the one-way

speed of light so

let's go through some of them i mean

can't we just use a high-speed camera

that shoots at a trillion frames a

second so we can

actually see light passing through an

object the problem is you're not

only seeing the light pass through the

object you're also seeing it bounce back

to the camera

measuring the two-way speed not one way

here you go get a spool of fiber optic

cable

you know i don't know like 186 000 miles

and then and you could shine the light

here and you have the other end of the

fiber here and you could

shine here and then wait and see the

delay see if it's one second later over

here

the thing is like that fiber's going

around and around and around so

it could be that when the light goes

this way over the top of the

loop it goes slower and then when it

goes on the bottom it goes faster

it all averages out in the fiber and

you're you're essentially getting lots

of round trips in that fiber

so you're never getting a one way what

if you center a synchronizing device

between your two clocks

and send out simultaneous pulses well

if the speed of light is the same in

both directions this perfectly

synchronizes your clocks

but if the speed of light is different

in each direction

one of the clocks will be ahead of the

other and it will be ahead by

just the right amount so that when you

measure the speed of light

you will find the value to be c even

though

that was not the speed the light was

traveling this is the same reason

gps synchronized clocks won't work the

whole

gps system is based on the assumption

that the speed of light is the same in

all directions

if the speed of light is different in

different directions the light pulses

from satellites

will travel at different speeds so the

clocks won't be properly synced

by that i mean they will always measure

c for the one-way speed of light

whether it is or isn't

how about starting with synchronized

clocks in the middle

and moving them apart with equal and

opposite speeds

that way the time dilation for each

clock will be the same and they'll still

be synchronized

when they reach the end points but again

this only works if the speed of light in

each direction is the same

if the speed of light depends on

direction then so does

time dilation you might think you could

move the clocks

really really slowly so that time

dilation is negligible

but if the speed of light is different

in different directions

you can't just use the standard formula

to calculate what that time dilation

would be i mean it could be a lot worse

than you think

so the reality is we're stuck we need

synchronized clocks to measure the

one-way speed of light

but we need to know the one-way speed of

light in order to synchronize our clocks

now this might sound like just an

academic concern so i want to go through

an example to illustrate just how

differently the universe works

if the speed of light is not the same in

all directions

let's say on mars mark is trying to

synchronize his clock with the earth

at noon mission control sends out a

message that says

this signal was sent at exactly 12

o'clock when mark receives this message

he uses the einstein synchronization

convention to set his clock

he knows the round-trip time delay is 20

minutes so he assumes the signal must

have taken 10 minutes to reach him

he programs his clock to 12 10 pm and

sends a return message

this reply sent to 12 10.

the message is received on earth at 12

20 pm so both parties know the

synchronization was successful

when the clock reads 12 20 on earth it

simultaneously reads

1220 on mars

but now consider what happens if the

speed of light is not the same in both

directions

let's say it is c over 2 from earth to

mars

and then instantaneous from mars back to

earth

no one knows this of course so they

continue to use the einstein convention

the message is sent from earth but now

it takes a full

20 minutes to reach mars but mark

doesn't know this

and as before he assumes the signal took

10 minutes to reach him so he sets his

clock to 12 10 pm

even though on earth it is now 12 20.

mark then sends

this reply sent to 12 10 pm which is

instantaneously received on earth

at 12 20 earth time

the experience for the two communicators

is the same

the same messages were received with the

same local time delays

but their clocks are out of sync by 10

minutes

what they think is the same moment for

the other observer

actually isn't and there is no way they

can ever recognize or

correct this error imagine if someone on

earth immediately responded

how long did this message take to reach

you it's now 12

20. well the message would take 20

minutes to reach mars

but due to the clocks being out of sync

it would arrive at 12 30 mars time

so mark would reply 10 minutes a message

that would

instantaneously reach the earth at 12 40

earth time

the space-time diagram shows how there

is flexibility in what you consider to

be the same moment

at two different locations and in how

you define the one-way speed of light

einstein chose the convention where the

one-way speed of light is always the

same

but from an experimental perspective any

other convention

is just as valid up to and including one

where the speed of light is c over two

one way

and instantaneous the other way

and in that case it's interesting to

think about what each observer is seeing

when they look

at the other mark would be seeing the

earth as it was

20 minutes ago but earth is seeing mars

in real time exactly as it is

right now and this effect wouldn't stop

at mars

look beyond it and you could see stars

hundreds of light years away

not as they looked centuries ago but

exactly

as they are right this instant

one of the things is you only know about

that light

when it reaches you and you don't know

anything about what journey it took to

get to you you just

see it and it's there so like it's

instantaneous

so an instantaneous interpretation of

that light is just as good as one where

it takes c to reach us

this is breaking my brain yeah yeah i

mean it's it's kind of unknowable isn't

it

it is unknowable that's the whole point

of the video is to say

we've all agreed and this is based on

something einstein wrote in 1905 we've

all agreed to just say

it's c in every direction but the truth

is the physics works the same

whether it's c or the c over two and

instantaneous

or anything in between as long as the

round trip works out to be c

none of physics breaks and that's the

crazy thing

so if we can never measure the one-way

speed of light and if it makes

no difference to any of the laws of

physics

then what's the point in even talking

about it

well that is certainly one valid

perspective in a debate that has been

ongoing since

1905. you know some physicists appeal to

occam's razor

isn't it just simpler if light travels

at the same speed in all directions

most working physicists just accept the

convention and move on with their lives

but i think it's important to point out

that it is just a convention

not an empirically verified fact

personally i find it fascinating that

this is something about the universe

that is hidden from us

sure the round trip speed of light is c

but does the one-way speed

even have a well-defined value and if it

doesn't

what does that mean for the concept of

simultaneity

when is right now on mars

does it even make sense to talk about

things happening at the same time

if they're separated by distance you

know maybe

this is an odd quirk of the universe and

there's no good reason for it

or maybe when physics takes the next

paradomatic leap our inability to

measure the one-way speed of light

will be the obvious clue to the way

general relativity quantum mechanics

space and time are all connected

and we'll wonder why we didn't see it

before

hey this video was sponsored by kiwico

they create

awesome projects and toys to get kids

making i use their crates with my son

and they are a lot of fun while also

being educational

and i'll put that link down in the

description below now

i think this is a fantastic offer

because these crates are a great

resource for learning at home

which is something anyone with kids is

doing a lot of

at the moment plus all the supplies you

need come

right in the box which means you don't

need to run to the store

which is again ideal now my kids are

still young but kiwico

offers eight subscription lines for

different age groups and different

topics

i do the koala crates with my oldest who

is now four

but the kit i'm actually showing you

here is for older kids

i built an infinity mirror which is

perfect for talking about the round trip

speed of light

there's lots of round trips going on in

here now can i just tell you how useful

it is to have a box turn up at your door

once

a month that is packed with fun things

to make all the supplies you need and

hours of entertainment right there

plus my son and i are learning something

new together

every month and we're connecting it's

become a special thing that we do

together so kiwi co is a perfect option

for a holiday gift

my son actually got his subscription

last year at this time

and i just think what other option will

get kids thinking

and doing throughout the year so for me

that's the most

important part i want my kids to feel

like they can make and discover things

on their own and these crates give them

that confidence

so click the link below to learn more
