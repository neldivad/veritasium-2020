Cottonelle this is like a scientist trap

it certainly is case in point that Space

Station commander Chris Hatfield what

this isn't is turbulent nope

this is largely laminar flow did

somebody say laminar flow if you didn't

know Destin from smarter every day loves

laminar flow where all the particles of

the fluid moved parallel to each other

in organized layers or laminae look at a

bubble where I live people will roll

down the window in their car when they

see me in the street and they will

scream turbulent flow is better to me

that happens that happens in Huntsville

yeah here's my argument to you Destin

that laminar flow is easier to love okay

but turbulent flow if you make that

effort is actually more awesome um no

turbulent flow is not better than

laminar it is awesome but it is not

better than laminar flow can I just say

I get it I get where Destin is coming

from

I mean laminar flow is pretty and it's

well behaved meanwhile turbulent flow is

a mess in more ways than one I mean

there isn't even a universally

agreed-upon definition of turbulent flow

you know it when you see it yeah so

instead of a formal definition in this

video we are going to build a checklist

of characteristics of turbulent flow so

that you know it when you see it and the

first characteristic of turbulent flow

is that it is unpredictable that's right

turbulent flow is messy it's

unpredictable it is literally

definitionally chaotic meaning it is

sensitively dependent on initial

conditions so if you were to change

something somewhere in the fluid well it

would completely change the final state

and that means you can't make

predictions with turbulent flow all you

can do is speak about it statistically I

mean there are the navier-stokes

equations which are meant to govern all

fluid flow

including turbulence but they are

notoriously difficult to solve in fact

there is a million-dollar prize for

anyone who can even make progress

towards getting insight into these

equations that would explain turbulence

so yeah I get it turbulence is a mess

laminar flow is easy to love it's like

the belle of the ball

whereas turbulent flow is kind of an

ugly duckling but in this video I want

to transform that ugly duckling into a

beautiful swan I want you to see that if

you make the effort the love you can

have for turbulent flow is so much

deeper and richer than that superficial

fling you have with laminar flow you are

looking at the motion of air in a room

which is generally turbulent the physics

girl and friends imaged a cross-section

of air using a fog machine and a laser

sheet one of the defining

characteristics of turbulent flow is

that it consists of many interacting

swirls of fluid also called Eddie's or

vortices these Eddie's span a huge range

of sizes in the case of air in a room

from the micrometer scale all the way up

to meters in diameter can you think of

another physical phenomenon that

exhibits structures over such a range of

sizes but turbulence can be much larger

the surface of the Sun is turbulent as

hot plasma rises to the surface in huge

convection currents the cell like

structures here are roughly the size of

Texas larger still are the turbulent

swirls on Jupiter the Great Red Spot is

a vortex bigger than the earth the rest

of the planet is covered in Eddie's of

all sizes down to the limits of our

ability to measure them from orbiting

spacecraft even the dust between the

stars is in turbulent motion it makes

radio sources twinkle the same way the

turbulence in our atmosphere makes stars

twinkle a stunning example of this

turbulent dust is the Orion Nebula

twenty four light years across

turbulence is cosmic in contrast

laminar flow has to be small this was

shown experimentally in 1883 Osborne

Reynolds passed water through a glass

pipe at different flow rates and to

visualize the flow he introduced a

stream of dye in the middle of the pipe

he found at low flow rates the dye

remained in a steady stream laminar flow

but as the flow rate increased the dye

began to oscillate back and forth and

beyond a certain critical point the dye

became completely diffused throughout

the pipe this was turbulent flow

Reynolds had observed another essential

characteristic of turbulence it is

diffusive meaning it mixes things

together turbulent flows caused things

to spread out not only die but also heat

or momentum they all become distributed

throughout the fluid Reynolds found the

transition to turbulence was not only

dependent on the flow rate turbulence

occurred more readily in wider pipes but

less readily with more viscous fluids

things like honey he calculated a

dimensionless quantity now called the

Reynolds number equal to the velocity of

the fluid times the characteristic

length say the diameter of the pipe

divided by the kinematic viscosity of

the fluid which you can think of as a

measure of its internal friction high

Reynolds numbers result in turbulent

flow have a look at the smoke rising

from a candle flame at first its laminar

but the hot gases accelerate as they

rise and once the Reynolds number gets

too big the smoke transitions to

turbulence so laminar flow only occurs

at low Reynolds numbers which means it

is limited to low speeds small sizes or

viscous fluids this is why in our

everyday lives most fluid flow is

turbulent turbulent flow is the rule

laminar flow is the exception the air

flowing in and out of your lungs is

turbulent the blood pumping through your

aorta is turbulent the atmosphere near

the surface of the earth is turbulent as

is the air flow in and around cumulus

and cumulonimbus clouds in fact modeling

shows that turbulent flow plays an

essential role in the formation of

rain drops so turbulence literally makes

it rain I'm going to create turbulence

in this Rio scopic fluid Rio scopic just

means that it shows the currents and it

does that by having these tiny particles

suspended in the water but what you

notice if you look at this turbulent

flow is that it gradually dies away and

that's because another characteristic of

turbulence is that it's dissipative that

is it takes in energy at the largest

scales at these big Eddie's and then

that energy gets transferred down to

smaller and smaller Eddie's until on the

smallest scales that energy gets

dissipated to the fluid as heat and so

in order to maintain turbulence you need

a constant source of energy something to

keep generating those large Eddie's

which is why we often think about

turbulence around objects that move

through a fluid things like planes cars

or boats so I want to think about the

interface between an object and the

fluid so picture fluid flowing over a

flat surface far away from the surface

the fluid isn't affected it keeps moving

with what will call its free stream

velocity but right at the surface due to

friction and adhesion the molecules of

the fluid are effectively stuck to the

surface their velocity is zero the fluid

next to it can flow only slowly due to

friction with this stationary layer

with increasing distance from the

surface the fluids velocity increases

from zero until it reaches the free

stream velocity and this region of

velocity adjustment is known as a

boundary layer in this case it's a

laminar boundary layer to form this

boundary layer the surface is applying a

force to the fluid that means the fluid

is applying an equal and opposite force

on the surface and this is known as skin

friction now if the fluid velocity is

particularly fast or if the surface is

long the boundary layer will grow and

eventually transition to turbulence in a

turbulent boundary layer the fluid

swirls and mixes bringing faster flowing

fluid closer to the surface and this

increases the skin friction so turbulent

boundary layers result in significantly

more drag than laminar ones and the

boundary layers around planes and large

ships are mostly turbulent and skin

friction accounts for the majority of

the drag they experience to make matters

worse laminar boundary layers can be

tripped into becoming turbulent by small

obstacles or rough surfaces in practice

this means clean smooth surfaces can

significantly reduce drag saving on fuel

costs if your car is really dirty it

likely gets worse gas mileage than if it

were clean this is what the Mythbusters

found when they tested it it also

explains why planes are frequently

washed so when you think about airplanes

I imagine that they would be built as

smooth as possible I think of the scene

in The Aviator where Leo says he wants

all of the rivets shaved down flush and

you can see that with this plane all of

these screws are are set in to the wing

and really to make the smoothest service

possible but then you look over here and

there are these ridges that stick up out

of the plane which seem to make no sense

I mean why would you add roughness to

the surface of the wing the answer is

actually to induce turbulence in the

flow of air over the wing

when cruising in level flight air

smoothly follows the curve of the wing

but at low speeds or higher angles of

attack the airflow can separate you can

think of it as not having enough energy

to follow the curve of the wing this

leads to a condition known as stall

which dramatically decreases lift here

you can see the airflow of via strings

taped onto the wing and as the plane

slows the flow separates and the strings

go wild this plane has stalled the way

to delay flow separation and stall is by

adding small fins on the wing called

vortex generators what these vortex

generators do is they actually cause

turbulence which mixes the faster

flowing higher up air down closer to the

surface so your energizing that fluid

flow as it passes over the wing and

because that flow has greater energy it

is able to follow the surface of the

wing for longer that means the air flow

remains attached and if you have

attached airflow over the wing then you

can maintain lift so in the case of

airplanes you actually need turbulence

and you induce more turbulence on the

wing in order to fly efficiently and

effectively and be able to climb at

hires angles of attack a similar

principle is at work with golf balls the

skull found out about turbulence the

hard way because they started playing

with a very smooth gospel and it

wouldn't fly as far as it would once it

got sort of dingo nicked and dirty you

can see why by observing the airflow in

a wind tunnel with a smooth ball the air

forms a laminar boundary layer over its

surface this leads to low skin friction

which is a good thing but it also means

the air flow separates easily leaving a

large wake of low pressure turbulent air

behind the ball and that leads to a

different form of drag is that a

pressure difference drag that's right

that's a pressure drag so the boundary

layer itself has a skin friction drag

and then if it separates there's a

pressure drag

and if you force that boundary layer to

become turbulent so you have mud or

roughness or mix on the golf ball then a

turbulent boundary I can actually get

further around the golf ball before it

separates and so it reduces that wake

and reduces that pressure drag so by

reducing the pressure drag more than

your increase in this kind rag that's

right golf ball travels further yep

golfers started carving grooves into

their golf balls before the aerodynamics

of this was fully understood and since

then dimples have found to work the best

for creating a turbulent boundary layer

dimples are very shallow compared to the

diameter of the golf ball but they have

a pretty massive effect what sort of

effect are we talking looking at the

drag right what we call a drag

coefficient you see a really big drop

almost a factor of two when the boundary

layer becomes turbulent so having a

turbulent boundary layer reduces the

size of the turbulent wake but turbulent

wakes themselves are interesting and

scientists are looking for ways to

harness the energy they contain I came

to Caltech to see this experiment where

the water flows around a cylinder and

transitions to turbulence in its wake

the flow is visualized here using a

fluorescent dye you can see how under

the right conditions vortices are shed

by one side of the cylinder and then the

other alternating back and forth in a

regular pattern this is known as

periodic vortex shedding and the pattern

it creates downstream is called a von

Karman vortex street these patterns

appear all over the place most

spectacularly in images taken from space

at this scale an island acts as the

obstacle that creates the periodic

vortex shedding and the vortex street is

made visible by patterns in the clouds

these patterns can even be seen from

ground level obviously this phenomenon

is not strictly turbulent because it

follows a predictable pattern but it is

part of the transition to turbulence and

these scientists are looking for ways to

harness the energy in these vortex

structures one experiment showed that if

you put a dead fish in the wake of an

object it will actually

swim upstream this suggests fish can

take advantage of turbulent water to

swim more efficiently it's just one way

that animals have adapted to live in a

turbulent world so to sum up turbulence

is everywhere it's inside you around you

from the smallest scales up to the

largest structures in the universe and

it's useful for flying airplanes forming

raindrops making golf balls fly further

and helping fish dead or alive swim

upstream

in contrast laminar flow is small

superficial it's a toy that's why it's

most notable use is in decorative

fountains it appeals to your desire for

order but the world like turbulence is

messy that's why I personally prefer the

richness the unpredictability of

turbulent flow no but but turbulent flow

has its places too I'm actually like

studying turbulent flow for like my my

schooling like I'm studying turbulent

flow in rocket nozzles that's a thing so

cheating on laminar flows what are you

doing um no yes yes maybe I don't know

but I what you will not get me to say

turbulent flow is not awesome and not

beautiful you will not get me to say

that so I will concede and I agree with

you turbulent flow is awesome I will

agree all right all right well it's just

not as awesome as laminar flow let's be

honest hey I just wanted to let you know

that this video was filmed before the

kovat outbreak and before the

shelter-in-place guidance was put into

effect now this portion of the video was

sponsored by Cottonelle flushable wipes

and since the outbreak they have been

working around the clock to get their

products back on shelves and back when I

filmed this video I actually did a

little experiment with these wipes to

find out how flushable they really are

so let's check that out so here I have a

baby wipe a paper towel and a cotton L

flushable wipe and I'm gonna submerge

all three of these in the fish tank for

30 minutes and then test how strong they

are flushable wipes actually became

really important to me

a couple years ago when the main sewer

for my building backed up into my condo

and flooded the entire downstairs and

the reason was my neighbor was flushing

baby wipes down the toilet and that

blocked up the whole system so it was

pretty awful but in fact this is the

thing people do a lot there was this

study from 2016 that found in the u.s.

60 million baby wipes are purchased

every year and seven million of them end

up being flushed down the toilet in fact

when they looked in the New York City

sewer system they found that 38 percent

of the stuff you find in there is

actually these baby wipes meanwhile 14

million flushable wipes are purchased

every year and flushed down a toilet but

they make up only 2% of what you find in

the sewer system so I think it's so

important that whatever you throw in the

toilet has to be able to break apart so

it doesn't clog everything up okay 30

minutes have elapsed and it is time to

test the strength of these three wipes

so I'm gonna test their strength with a

roll of pennies here we go on the baby

wipe it can still support that wait what

about the paper towel can still support

that wait what about the cut now

flushable wipe ah it fell through so

this is what makes the Cottonelle

flushable wipe flushable it immediately

starts to break down after flushing so

you should purchase some cotton nail

flushable wipes and try them out for

yourself want to thank cotton al for

sponsoring this video and I want to

thank you for watching
