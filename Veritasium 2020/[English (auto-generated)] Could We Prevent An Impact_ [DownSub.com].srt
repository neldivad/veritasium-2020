00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,799
more about them at the end of the show

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,640
on february 15 2013 over chelyabinsk

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,439
russia

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,520
an asteroid heavier than the eiffel

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,240
tower slammed into the atmosphere

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,880
and then 30 kilometers above the ground

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,800
it exploded

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,359
this violent event was brighter than the

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,159
sun

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,440
but so high up that it was silent

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,960
for a full 90 seconds after the blast

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,920
which only made the devastation worse so

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,239
you see all these videos of people

15
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,600
looking look at what was that they see

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,079
the

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,879
smoke trail in the sky oh that's amazing

18
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:49,520
and then

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,680
you know just when you think nothing's

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,120
gonna happen the shock wave hits

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,600
it blows out the windows thousand people

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,680
got glass in their face in their eyes

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,719
because they're looking through the

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,760
windows

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,239
the shockwave damaged thousands of

26
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,720
buildings and injured

27
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,119
1500 people

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,000
what makes the chelyabinsk incident kind

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,280
of embarrassing

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,080
is that the very same day scientists had

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,240
predicted that an asteroid would make a

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,720
close

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,240
flyby of earth and they were right

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,640
16 hours after chelyabinsk a similar

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,680
sized asteroid

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,560
known as duende came within 27 000

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,720
kilometers of earth's surface

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
that's closer than satellites in

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,880
geosynchronous orbit

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,799
but while they correctly predicted this

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,079
close approach

42
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,640
they completely missed the unrelated

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,759
asteroid that exploded over russia

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,680
and the truth is this happens all the

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,159
time we're really not that good at

46
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,040
detecting asteroids before they hit us

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,119
since 1988 over 1200 asteroids bigger

48
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,720
than a meter have collided with the

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,439
earth

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,560
and of those we detected only five

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,439
before they hit never with more than a

52
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,360
day of warning

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,280
with all our technology and all the

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,040
telescopes across the earth

55
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,520
not to mention the ones in space why do

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,038
we struggle to detect

57
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,920
dangerous asteroids before they strike

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,959
what are the chances

59
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,520
that a big asteroid will hit wiping out

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,000
most

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,280
if not all life on earth and

62
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,400
if we saw one coming what could we do

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,370
about it

64
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:32,470
[Music]

65
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,000
asteroids are the leftover debris from

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,200
when our solar system formed

67
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,720
four and a half billion years ago rocks

68
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,680
and dust clumped together into molten

69
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,519
protoplanets

70
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,640
inside heavy elements metals like

71
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,599
iron nickel and iridium sank into the

72
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,400
core

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,720
leaving lighter silicate minerals on the

74
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,239
surface

75
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,959
some of these protoplanets grew into the

76
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,200
planets we know today

77
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,400
but many more collided with each other

78
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,840
breaking into pieces

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,680
these pieces continued orbiting the sun

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,440
and smashing into each other and

81
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,400
breaking into even smaller fragments

82
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,159
these became the asteroids which is why

83
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,239
some of them are rocky loose

84
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,599
conglomerates of

85
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,879
gravel-sized rocks called rubble piles

86
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,120
and others from the cores of

87
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,400
planetesimals

88
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,440
are mostly metal so this

89
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,640
is this is an iron meteorite

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,440
and essentially it's the piece of a core

91
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,640
of a small

92
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,560
planetary body like basically a small

93
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,680
planet

94
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,319
that formed four and a half billion

95
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,360
years ago

96
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,680
differentiated so the core material fell

97
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,480
out

98
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,200
and then this thing was smashed apart by

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,519
a collision with another asteroid

100
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,439
that's the oldest thing you'll ever see

101
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,000
most of the asteroids have stable orbits

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,840
between mars and jupiter

103
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,519
in the main asteroid belt but some

104
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,478
have made their way closer to earth and

105
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,759
these are known as

106
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,040
near-earth objects they are of greatest

107
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,680
interest to

108
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,800
us because of the threat they pose in

109
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,000
his last book

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,240
stephen hawking considered an asteroid

111
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,160
impact to be the greatest

112
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,280
threat to life on earth but

113
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,680
finding asteroids is difficult for

114
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,280
several reasons

115
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,199
most are spotted by ground-based

116
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,360
telescopes so what you do is you take

117
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,120
a sequence of pictures one two three one

118
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,199
two three four and you look for

119
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,840
essentially a moving dot and it's moving

120
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,919
because it's orbiting around the sun

121
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,840
whereas the stuff far away the stars and

122
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,240
galaxies are not

123
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,960
but you have to look carefully asteroids

124
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,280
are

125
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,320
not very big they range from meters up

126
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,639
to

127
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,360
kilometers in size and in the vast

128
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,639
expanse of space

129
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,680
rocks like that just don't stand out and

130
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,000
even the small ones can be damaging

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,240
the chelyabinsk meteor was only around

132
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,080
20 meters in diameter

133
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,440
roughly the width of two school buses

134
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,560
plus asteroids are rough and dark

135
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,680
they only reflect around 15 of the light

136
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,960
that hits them

137
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,360
so our best chance to see them is when

138
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,000
they're fully illuminated by the sun

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,479
and that's why over 85 percent of the

140
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,560
near-earth asteroids we've detected

141
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,440
were found in the 45 degrees of sky

142
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,240
directly

143
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,120
opposite the sun this is called the

144
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,800
opposition effect and

145
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,639
it means there are likely more

146
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,639
near-earth and potentially hazardous

147
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,600
asteroids

148
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,320
that haven't been detected yet any

149
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,039
asteroid

150
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,880
approaching from the direction of the

151
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,080
sun just

152
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,120
can't be seen this is exactly what

153
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,600
happened

154
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,639
with chelyabinsk

155
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,919
so far we have detected and cataloged

156
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,960
a million asteroids the vast majority of

157
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,360
which

158
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,639
are in the main asteroid belt but

159
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,240
24 000 are near earth objects

160
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,400
ones that we need to keep a particularly

161
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,759
close eye on

162
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,680
because even once you've detected an

163
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,840
asteroid it's hard to tell

164
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,919
if it will hit the earth so if you just

165
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,199
discover an object

166
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,280
and you only have data from a few days

167
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,319
then you can't really

168
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,520
tell where it's going to go because

169
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,360
you're trying to take this little

170
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
arc of motion and predict it far into

171
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,960
the future so what you need is

172
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,120
observations over years and years

173
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,800
but even if you have perfect

174
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,639
observations of an asteroid

175
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,039
there's kind of a fundamental limit to

176
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,440
how far in the future you can predict

177
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,599
and that's because a couple of effects

178
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,800
but one is that you know

179
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,120
they're not just orbiting the sun with

180
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,479
no other influence

181
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,639
all of the planets have gravity and all

182
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,919
of the planets are pulling

183
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,720
on near-earth asteroids and can change

184
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,520
the orbit

185
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,680
significantly so there is something

186
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,319
called dynamical chaos which basically

187
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,120
means

188
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,720
after a certain amount of time you don't

189
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,039
know where the asteroid is going to be

190
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,800
and in practice what that means is we

191
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
can't do any work

192
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,440
more than 100 years in the future so the

193
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,280
maximum time you can predict

194
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,840
with any accuracy at all where a body

195
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
will be is about 100 years

196
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,720
and this is pretty important because we

197
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,360
know with

198
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,319
certainty if one does hit the results

199
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:30,800
will be

200
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,440
dramatic

201
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,039
this is behringer crater in arizona it's

202
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,720
named after mining engineer

203
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,039
daniel behringer who was the first to

204
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:41,919
suggest

205
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,639
it was formed by a meteorite impact the

206
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,440
prevailing view even up until the 1950s

207
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
was that it was created by volcanic

208
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,639
activity

209
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,360
but behringer was convinced it was the

210
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,199
site of an iron meteorite

211
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,319
impact so in 1903 he

212
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,280
staked a mining claim and began drilling

213
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,240
for the metallic

214
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,039
meteorite which he believed to be worth

215
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,720
more than a billion

216
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,360
1903 dollars yeah so people are

217
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,960
motivated by money right so they thought

218
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,720
hey we can get some iron for free

219
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,800
basically so they started to drill

220
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,639
in the bottom of the crater and found

221
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
nothing

222
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,280
and then they started to do other

223
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
exploratory drills and this went on for

224
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,160
years and

225
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,400
decades they started to drill sideways

226
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,840
somebody said you know maybe it came in

227
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,599
from an angle which it did

228
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,919
and maybe the iron is is not under the

229
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:30,960
middle but maybe it's

230
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,559
over there under the wall so he was

231
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,080
doing drilling if you go there you can

232
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,679
see the drills now

233
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,200
he was drilling around the wall he found

234
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
nothing so what they didn't realize is

235
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,719
when you have

236
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,440
an impact at high speed it's not like

237
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,200
you're throwing a stone

238
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,040
into a brick wall you know and it makes

239
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,640
a hole and sticks in there

240
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,600
or just bounces off it's explosive it's

241
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
like totally explosive so the kinetic

242
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,440
energy of the projectile comes in

243
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,839
maybe 30 kilometers per second the

244
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,680
kinetic energy of the projectile is big

245
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,519
enough to completely vaporize the

246
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,839
projectile turns it into a gas

247
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,760
and that gas is super hot and super high

248
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,560
pressure and it explodes and it blows

249
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,360
out the crater

250
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,440
so the projectile doesn't really exist

251
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,040
after the impact i mean little pieces

252
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,399
can survive

253
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,519
but this 50 meter body was basically

254
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,680
obliterated so he was looking for

255
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,560
something that

256
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,640
did not exist he spent 27 years

257
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,720
mining the crater drilling down to a

258
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,360
depth of over 400 meters

259
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
but what he was searching for had

260
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,800
vaporized on impact

261
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,800
50 000 years earlier the 50-meter

262
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,920
asteroid

263
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,320
not that much bigger than chelyabinsk

264
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,040
released

265
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,000
the energy equivalent of 10 megatons of

266
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,120
tnt

267
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,160
that's over 600 times the energy of the

268
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,240
hiroshima bomb so

269
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,399
the thing that most closely resembles a

270
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,839
meteorite impact

271
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:05,839
is a very large nuclear explosion

272
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,959
this is the actual size of the t-rex

273
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,040
skull and i thought

274
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,720
this is such a cool thing i got to have

275
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,470
it so i bought the t-rex

276
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,079
[Applause]

277
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,000
the dinosaurs were wiped out by a 10

278
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,360
kilometer sized

279
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,200
asteroid that hit about 65 million years

280
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,079
ago so

281
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,160
above the critical size which is

282
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,320
probably a couple of kilometers

283
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,920
uh an impactor delivers so much energy

284
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,570
that it has a global effect

285
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,489
[Music]

286
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,959
so essentially it launches a whole bunch

287
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,320
of debris

288
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,880
into sub-orbital trajectories so the

289
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,040
ejector goes around the earth

290
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,519
falls back into the earth all over even

291
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,800
on the other side of the planet from

292
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,839
where the impact occurred

293
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,680
and what that means is the whole sky

294
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,760
lights up with

295
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,800
wall-to-wall meteors

296
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,959
so you can imagine the sky turning from

297
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,079
you know a nice

298
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,200
blue day like today into essentially

299
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,360
a red hot glow like being inside a

300
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,230
toaster oven

301
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,880
[Music]

302
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,720
so the first effect of this impact apart

303
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,240
from the initial blast

304
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,920
near where the actual impact occurred

305
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,079
the first effect is the sky

306
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,560
turns into a great source of heat and it

307
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,079
cooks everything on the ground so these

308
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,600
guys were basically

309
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,240
cooked cooked alive cooked alive as they

310
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,880
were walking around

311
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,399
the only animals that had a chance were

312
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,720
the ones living in tunnels

313
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,880
under the ground or maybe um in the

314
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,000
water

315
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,839
they were able to to come back and take

316
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,079
over without having to deal with the

317
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,680
dinosaurs as a

318
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,240
major obstacle what are our chances that

319
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,519
earth gets hit

320
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,720
by a another 10 kilometer or bigger

321
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,839
asteroid

322
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,000
in your lifetime assuming you live to be

323
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
a hundred years old you have a 10

324
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,079
kilometer impactor like the kt

325
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,200
extinction event every 100 million years

326
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,560
or something like that

327
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,480
so the probability of getting it in one

328
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,800
year is one in 100 million so you have

329
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,959
one in a million chance of dying from

330
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,200
a 10 kilometer impact but because we

331
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,040
know that there are no

332
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,399
10 kilometer impactors with a path that

333
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,760
intersects the earth

334
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,920
for the next 100 years your chance of

335
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,160
dying from that is actually zero

336
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,320
so work done already has reduced that

337
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,160
down you know from one in a million to

338
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,680
to nothing

339
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
so the good news is there won't be

340
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,000
another dinosaur style extinction event

341
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,680
in our lifetimes

342
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,320
but there are exponentially more

343
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,720
asteroids of smaller sizes

344
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,200
for every 10 kilometer asteroid there

345
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,880
are roughly a thousand

346
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,519
one kilometer asteroids and they're

347
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,959
still capable of doing

348
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,079
a lot of damage one or two kilometers

349
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,040
is capable of causing local but massive

350
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,480
damage so that means

351
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,240
you know instead of wiping out the

352
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,519
entire world

353
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,000
you would wipe out the equivalent of

354
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,560
some

355
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,519
european country like france or germany

356
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,160
to mention

357
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,839
two of my favorites so you would

358
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,079
obliterate those countries

359
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,600
with the impact of a one or two

360
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,279
kilometer sized body

361
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,760
do we know about all the one to two

362
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,639
kilometer

363
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,560
bodies that could hit us we think that

364
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,000
we know 90 something percent maybe 98

365
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,200
of those bodies have been identified

366
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,120
and we have their orbits and we can make

367
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,440
reasonable predictions for the next

368
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,600
10 years or something about where

369
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,480
they'll be

370
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,120
and we seem to be okay at the moment but

371
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,160
you know

372
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,920
uh what about the ones that are just a

373
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,199
little bit less than a

374
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,480
kilometer what about the ones that are

375
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,399
800 meters that's still pretty

376
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,279
pretty savage if it hits and this is

377
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,199
possibly where the greatest threat of

378
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,880
asteroids remains

379
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,519
a few hundred meters is large enough to

380
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,600
obliterate a large city

381
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,000
but small enough that we haven't

382
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,519
detected them all yet

383
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,360
we're missing a lot of hundred meter

384
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,880
sized projectiles

385
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,120
and those guys are big enough to cause

386
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,639
substantial damage on the earth

387
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,240
depending on where they hit

388
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,000
so it could destroy a city yeah it would

389
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,920
knock down the buildings in the city

390
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,600
it would cause city-wide fire and

391
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,399
if it hit the ground it would throw up

392
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,040
ejecta

393
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,560
that would come back down and rain on

394
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,399
the ground would be high-speed ejector

395
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,880
that would obliterate a 100 kilometer

396
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,000
zone

397
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,399
around it and this could happen tomorrow

398
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,990
well it could yeah

399
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,560
[Laughter]

400
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,760
if we saw a big one coming

401
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
what's our best bet for i mean could we

402
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,279
do anything about it what would we do

403
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:39,760
about it

404
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,600
is there anything we can do to actively

405
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,160
no there's nothing we can do

406
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,519
i was on a committee that looked at that

407
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,440
okay like 10 years ago what could we

408
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,839
what could we do one option would be to

409
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:50,880
try to bomb it

410
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,279
it's a standard thing we don't know how

411
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,399
that would work out

412
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,760
even when you got it there and even if

413
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,079
you could explode it on the surface

414
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,320
or in the surface it's not clear what

415
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,680
you would do because typically what

416
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,720
happens is you

417
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,920
blow up a body and the fragments move

418
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,240
out they expand out but not very quickly

419
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,440
and then gravity pulls them back

420
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,680
together again so it would reform

421
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,079
as a rubble pile if it was not already a

422
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,680
rubble pile to begin with which it

423
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,199
probably would be because of past

424
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,079
impacts

425
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,480
so blowing up a rubble pile is something

426
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
that we don't really know about

427
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,079
another idea is you could attach you

428
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,760
could be all gentle and attach

429
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,839
a rocket to the asteroid and just try to

430
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,440
push it aside let's nudge it aside

431
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,639
instead of trying to blow it up let's

432
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,399
just push it gently aside

433
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,000
so that it deflects it and it doesn't

434
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,160
hit the earth the trouble is

435
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,680
when you work out the numbers none of

436
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,600
the rockets that we have can push it

437
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,880
around enough you would have to keep the

438
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,440
rockets

439
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,040
attached to the surface which we don't

440
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,560
know how to do remember it's a rotating

441
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,279
body

442
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,920
for centuries to have a significant

443
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,600
effect on the motion of the asteroid so

444
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,480
forget

445
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,519
bombs forget attaching rockets

446
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,360
ablating the surface basically you boil

447
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,720
the surface with a laser

448
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,639
we don't have any lasers powerful enough

449
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,959
and probably can't make lasers powerful

450
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,279
enough to do that from the earth we

451
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,800
would have to take the lasers to the

452
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,720
object which is even more difficult

453
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,199
the idea that you could wrap an asteroid

454
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,199
in cooking foil aluminum cooking foil is

455
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,880
another nice one that may be a good one

456
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,920
the best one

457
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,440
but it still doesn't really work because

458
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,040
we don't know how to do that

459
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,440
we don't have a way to launch enough

460
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,480
cooking foil

461
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,560
to wrap up an asteroid and change its

462
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,720
radiative properties which would itself

463
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,440
move the asteroid around so the truth is

464
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,959
to be honest we do not

465
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,000
have a way now to deflect

466
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,040
a kilometer-sized asteroid at all

467
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,199
that could destroy a country yeah we

468
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,720
just don't have a way

469
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,880
10 kilometers 10 kilometers is

470
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,240
absolutely a thousand times more

471
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,360
hopeless

472
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,600
so when when we discussed this you know

473
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,839
we we had all these grand ideas oh we

474
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,120
could do this and this and none of them

475
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,199
worked we came down to the most basic

476
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,920
idea well

477
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,360
maybe if we could figure out where the

478
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,199
asteroid is going to hit like which city

479
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,000
is it going to

480
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,199
explode over we can evacuate that city

481
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,560
and then we looked at the history of

482
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,279
city evacuations and we looked at cases

483
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,160
you know where

484
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,919
for example you have like a week's

485
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,280
warning where some

486
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,520
hurricane system is going to come in and

487
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,799
flood a city

488
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,760
and an evacuation uh just doesn't work

489
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,640
either

490
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,319
and the reason is very very simple like

491
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,839
going into a city there are not that

492
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,319
many

493
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,880
freeways if you have millions of people

494
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,319
trying to get on a freeway

495
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,720
the first time a car breaks down you you

496
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,760
block that freeway

497
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,000
so instantly you have millions of people

498
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,240
trying to get out of the target zone

499
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,160
and and they won't be able to because

500
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,600
all of the roads will be

501
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,880
instantly blocked so again even that

502
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,799
even evacuation of a city is probably

503
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,320
the most

504
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,480
hopeful thing that we could try to do

505
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
even that's really really difficult

506
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,640
because of the large numbers of people

507
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,520
involved

508
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,600
what i think all reasonable people would

509
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,880
conclude is

510
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,840
let's do the thing that we can do first

511
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,200
so let's look for them

512
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,799
let's do the surveys let's build the

513
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,960
telescopes let's put this telescope in

514
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,559
space that will be

515
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,720
a major contribution to understanding

516
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,640
the threat from the asteroids

517
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,520
and then when we find a particular

518
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,160
object

519
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,640
that looks especially dangerous then we

520
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,679
can focus on it

521
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,160
we can focus everything we have on it

522
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,000
and we can begin to think seriously and

523
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,600
with real motivation

524
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,880
about ways to deflect it

525
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,720
now if you're concerned about the world

526
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,039
ending in an asteroid impact

527
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,760
let me set your mind at ease there are

528
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,320
many

529
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,720
other potential global catastrophes

530
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,840
summarized in this

531
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,400
map of doom made by my friend dom over

532
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,080
at domain of science

533
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,600
so if you want to see which of these

534
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,679
horrible scenarios is likeliest to be

535
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,559
our downfall

536
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,320
well go check out the video on his

537
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,640
channel

538
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,799
my oldest now knows how to do the

539
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,240
sponsor message

540
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,200
do you want to say it this episode is

541
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,080
sponsored by kiwico

542
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,799
very good kiwi co creates awesome

543
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,240
projects and toys

544
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,799
to get kids making they offer eight

545
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,480
subscription lines for kids of

546
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,679
all ages all the way down to newborns

547
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,039
and with the holidays right around the

548
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,240
corner kiwi co is the perfect gift idea

549
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,559
as a parent i know that lots of gifts

550
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,559
get unwrapped and played with for a

551
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,440
little while

552
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,679
but then kids lose interest but a kiwi

553
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,520
co-crate subscription will keep kids

554
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,480
engaged

555
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,720
learning and making throughout the year

556
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
now i use their crates with my sons

557
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,480
and they are a lot of fun while also

558
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,760
being educational

559
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,600
and i want my kids to see learning as a

560
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,080
form of play and kiwico really helps me

561
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,720
do that

562
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,320
plus all the supplies you need come

563
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,000
right in the box so you never need

564
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,799
to run out to the store now here i built

565
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,120
a

566
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,840
perpetual calendar a reminder that each

567
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,960
passing day

568
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,000
