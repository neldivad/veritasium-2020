2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,799
more about them at the end of the show

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,679
until recently half the universe was

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,320
missing

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,200
or hidden or just undetected and no i'm

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,200
not talking about dark matter or dark

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,160
energy which make up

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,720
27 and 68 percent of our universe

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,600
respectively

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,760
no i'm talking about normal ordinary

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,199
matter which makes up

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,680
you and me and the planets and stars and

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,199
nebulae and basically

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,160
everything you can see and since most of

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,840
this stuff is made of protons and

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,520
neutrons which are forms of

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,239
baryons this has been known as the

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,399
missing baryon problem

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,399
we expect the universe to be made up of

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,960
five percent baryonic matter

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,360
but when we go looking we only find two

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,520
and a half percent

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,879
now the first question you're probably

24
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,280
asking is why should we expect the

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,960
universe to be five percent

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,120
ordinary baryonic matter in the first

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,079
place

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,480
the answer is because with that density

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,120
we can explain the relative abundances

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,520
of different elements that we observe in

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,400
the universe

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,439
specifically the ratio of deuterium to

33
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,680
hydrogen to helium

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,920
in the beginning like right after the

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,960
big bang

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,479
there were all of these neutrons and

37
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,240
protons whizzing around it was

38
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,159
incredibly hot and there was tons of

39
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,600
radiation the universe was

40
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,159
radiation dominated but as the universe

41
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:22,880
expanded

42
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,280
it cooled to the point where protons and

43
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,080
neutrons

44
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,159
could start fusing together a

45
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,240
particularly stable nucleus to form

46
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,720
would be helium-4 made of two neutrons

47
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,920
and two protons

48
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,720
the problem was to form helium-4 you

49
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,680
first have to form

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,040
deuterium one proton and one neutron and

51
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,680
this is a less stable nucleus and as

52
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,040
quickly as it formed

53
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,000
it would get smashed apart but by about

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,680
10 seconds after the big bang

55
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,759
the universe had cooled sufficiently

56
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,880
that deuterium

57
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,119
could form and as soon as it did it

58
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,399
would rapidly fuse

59
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,799
into helium the rate at which this

60
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,880
happened depended on the density of

61
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,560
matter in the early universe

62
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,799
the higher the density the faster this

63
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,640
fusion could occur

64
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,959
then by 20 minutes after the big bang

65
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,239
the temperature had dropped

66
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,800
low enough that fusion could no longer

67
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,599
occur

68
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,280
so at this point the elemental

69
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,360
abundances were locked in

70
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,480
like a snapshot of this moment there was

71
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,280
75

72
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,560
hydrogen and 25 helium by mass which

73
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,319
is basically still what we observe in

74
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,000
the universe today

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,959
of the hydrogen nuclei 26 out of every

76
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:31,680
million

77
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,319
were deuterium

78
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,400
what's amazing about deuterium is that

79
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,360
it's stable

80
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,080
it doesn't decay and there are no known

81
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,680
processes that can produce it in

82
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,879
significant quantities

83
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,040
since the big bang and that means

84
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,640
virtually all the deuterium in the

85
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,519
universe today

86
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,560
including the one out of every 6 000

87
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,319
hydrogen atoms in tap water

88
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,680
was created not in stars but in

89
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,959
the first 20 minutes after the big bang

90
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,720
when we look deep into space the oldest

91
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,680
light we can see

92
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,680
is the cosmic microwave background

93
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,959
radiation the

94
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,680
afterglow of the big bang which has been

95
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,400
traveling

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,800
through the universe unimpeded since

97
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,920
about 400

98
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,560
000 years after the big bang and so we

99
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,280
can literally

100
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,159
count up those photons and work out the

101
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,000
density of radiation

102
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,560
right after the big bang and using the

103
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,959
value of 26 deuterium nuclei

104
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,000
per million hydrogen nuclei well we

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,159
can work out the ratio of baryonic

106
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,680
matter to photons

107
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,280
and that is how we work out that there

108
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,120
should be about five percent

109
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,239
baryonic matter in the universe so in

110
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,440
the late 1990s

111
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,680
scientists went looking for all this

112
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,040
baryonic matter

113
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,560
it was a census of sorts they added up

114
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,439
all of the planets and stars and black

115
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,400
holes

116
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,439
galaxies dust clouds gas basically

117
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,480
everything you can see or infer exists

118
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,159
using a telescope

119
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,640
and what they found is that everything

120
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,879
that i normally think of as the actual

121
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,080
stuff in our universe it only makes up

122
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,120
barely 20 percent of all the baryonic

123
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,159
matter

124
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,519
so where is the rest well

125
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,238
not all ordinary matter is glowing

126
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,560
brightly or is illuminated by nearby

127
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,440
stars

128
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,160
it's not dark matter but it is ordinary

129
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,880
matter

130
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,680
that is just in darkness and so if you

131
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,800
want to find

132
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,080
those baryons well one way is to use a

133
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,199
backlight

134
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,919
a bright source of light very far away

135
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,240
and that also means in the very early

136
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,199
universe

137
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,400
and quasars are the perfect backlight

138
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,639
their luminosity can be thousands of

139
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,320
times that of whole

140
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,199
galaxies the light comes from the

141
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,280
accretion disk of a supermassive black

142
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,840
hole

143
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,240
at the center of an early galaxy as it

144
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,280
engulfs

145
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,400
all this matter and since it is so

146
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,039
distant

147
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,199
the light we receive from quasars is

148
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,880
heavily redshifted

149
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,400
for example the light emitted when a

150
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,080
hydrogen atom goes from its first

151
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,160
excited state to its ground state the

152
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,600
lyman alpha transition

153
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,440
it produces ultraviolet light of around

154
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,440
121.6 nanometers in a lab

155
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,759
but from a quasar it can be observed as

156
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,639
a peak

157
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,320
in their spectrum at over 560 nanometers

158
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,080
that is yellow light what's fascinating

159
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,160
is if you look to the left of this peak

160
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,280
you see many

161
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,479
little dips these are absorption lines

162
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,199
created by

163
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,680
neutral hydrogen atoms that lie along

164
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,919
our line of sight with the quasar

165
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,080
when light from the quasar reaches

166
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,360
neutral hydrogen

167
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,199
the photons that can excite the

168
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,800
electrons from the ground state to the

169
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,000
first excited state

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,800
are absorbed this is the same lyman

171
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,400
alpha transition

172
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,479
but since these patches of hydrogen gas

173
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,759
are closer to us

174
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,960
they are less red-shifted so the notches

175
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,479
they make in the spectrum

176
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,960
are at shorter and shorter wavelengths

177
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,560
the closer the gas is

178
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,680
to us this has been described

179
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,880
as the lyman alpha forest

180
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,360
it's like a one-dimensional map that

181
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,160
shows us

182
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,360
where and how much neutral hydrogen gas

183
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,000
lies along the line connecting us to the

184
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,560
quasar

185
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,600
adding all of that neutral hydrogen gas

186
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,680
into our baryon budget brings us

187
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,960
almost to 50 percent so where

188
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,840
is the other half of the baryons well

189
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,080
computer simulations of the entire

190
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,720
universe

191
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,600
suggested they are out there just in

192
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,280
between the galaxies

193
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,479
in these sheets or filaments and they're

194
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,840
very spread out just

195
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,960
one to ten particles per cubic meter

196
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,599
plus these particles are ionized so they

197
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,880
don't absorb the light

198
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,960
like the neutral hydrogen gas and

199
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,400
they're in a temperature range

200
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,199
between about 100 000 and 10 million

201
00:06:59,199 --> 00:06:59,919
kelvin

202
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,160
a range astronomers like to refer to as

203
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,440
warm hot

204
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,080
so this is known as the warm hot

205
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,759
intergalactic medium or

206
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,800
whim for short but finding the whim

207
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,960
has been a real challenge because

208
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,319
they're ionized because of their

209
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,440
temperature they only

210
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,720
emit or absorb in the high energy uv or

211
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,599
low energy x-rays now some people have

212
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,080
used

213
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
very sophisticated techniques to try to

214
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,440
find the whim

215
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,080
but then recently a naturally occurring

216
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,280
physical phenomenon

217
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,360
allowed us to find all of the missing

218
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,639
baryons

219
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,080
let's find out how first we need to talk

220
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,759
lightning and i promise this is related

221
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,759
okay so did you know that it's possible

222
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,160
to detect lightning from the other side

223
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,720
of the earth this is because lightning

224
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,520
produces a

225
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,680
flash of electromagnetic radiation in

226
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,360
all parts of the spectrum

227
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,360
i mean we see the white light but

228
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,280
there's also broad spectrum

229
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,680
radio waves which are released and if

230
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,440
you were nearby you could detect those

231
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,840
as

232
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,120
a pulse but the very low frequency radio

233
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,479
waves can actually travel

234
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,960
up and out of the atmosphere and they

235
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,280
get guided along the earth's magnetic

236
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,240
field lines

237
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,800
out several radii from the earth and

238
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,919
then back down

239
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,599
where they can be detected in the other

240
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,360
hemisphere except

241
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,120
if they're detected there they don't

242
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,440
come in as a single pulse

243
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,840
instead they are spread out as a

244
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,639
whistler

245
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,000
now if you play these radio waves

246
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,080
through a speaker we can actually hear

247
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,639
them so

248
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,420
listen to this

249
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,489
[Music]

250
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,599
you hear that descending tone that

251
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,479
sounds like a

252
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,360
sci-fi laser gun yeah that is lightning

253
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,479
on the other side

254
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,600
of the earth so what's happening here

255
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,680
well as the radio waves travel through

256
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,440
the earth's magnetosphere

257
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,080
they encounter free electrons which

258
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,440
slows them down

259
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,720
and more for the lower frequency waves

260
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,440
this is dispersion just as a prism

261
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,519
separates white light into its component

262
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,240
colors

263
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,160
the plasma in the magnetosphere

264
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,680
separates the radio waves

265
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,080
into its component frequencies low

266
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,680
frequencies are slowed down more than

267
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,880
high frequencies

268
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,760
so what started as a pulse ends up as a

269
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,480
whistler

270
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,880
and the amount of dispersion tells you

271
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,120
how many free electrons that radio wave

272
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,839
had to pass through to reach the

273
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,959
detector now just imagine

274
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,040
we could do something very similar to

275
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,440
find all the ionized baryons in the

276
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,320
universe

277
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,440
all we would need is a bright flash

278
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,240
of radio waves somewhere in the distant

279
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,440
universe

280
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,120
and as if on cue in 2007 astronomers

281
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,480
found the first

282
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,120
fast radio burst which is just what it

283
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,560
sounds like a very

284
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,600
short duration pulse of intense

285
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,120
radio waves and it came from the deep

286
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,519
universe from other galaxies now these

287
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,720
pulses can be

288
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,839
incredibly powerful i'm talking billions

289
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,000
or trillions of times as powerful as the

290
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,120
sun but they last

291
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,320
for on order of a millisecond we don't

292
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,000
really know what creates them though

293
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,320
some people suspect that it's magnetars

294
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,959
or

295
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,360
neutron stars or some sort of collision

296
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,000
between

297
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,480
these very powerful massive objects like

298
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,519
black holes and

299
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,800
neutron stars but for our purposes

300
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,040
all we need to know is that those

301
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,800
flashes exist

302
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,720
and that we can use them to look at

303
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,320
their dispersion and figure out

304
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,800
how many ionized baryons are between us

305
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,920
and the source

306
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
and this is exactly what one recent

307
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,279
paper did in

308
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,079
nature they plotted out the dispersion

309
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,040
measure of

310
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,200
several of these fast radio bursts

311
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,760
versus the redshift of their host

312
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,480
galaxy and what they found was sure

313
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,200
enough

314
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
the further out these fast radio bursts

315
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,519
were the more dispersed

316
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,519
their signal when it reached the earth

317
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,680
and in fact using their measurements

318
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,440
they were able to estimate the

319
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,480
total baryonic matter that is out there

320
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,160
and that includes all the ionized

321
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,519
particles in the whim

322
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,360
and they found that it was five percent

323
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,079
they found the missing baryons roughly

324
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,200
50 percent of them

325
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,600
are in that warm hot intergalactic

326
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,640
medium

327
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,880
and so this validates what we had been

328
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,279
thinking the whole time

329
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,040
you know what surprised me in making

330
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,880
this video was realizing

331
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,959
just how little of the ordinary matter

332
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,640
from the big bang ended up in things

333
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,800
like stars and galaxies what i normally

334
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,519
consider

335
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,680
as the stuff of the universe no that's

336
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,760
only like 10 or 20 percent of all the

337
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,120
baryonic matter

338
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,200
so it turns out the formation of these

339
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,320
interesting structures

340
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,360
is a really inefficient process but this

341
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,240
finding is

342
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,040
yet another triumph for science those

343
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
computer simulations run decades ago

344
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,160
turned out largely

345
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,480
to be correct and so everyone involved

346
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,399
should be congratulated

347
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,160
but this also highlights for me the

348
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,519
difference between scientists and

349
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,560
non-scientists

350
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,519
i feel like non-scientists like being

351
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,320
right they like

352
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,839
when things turn out the way they were

353
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,839
expecting but scientists on the other

354
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:02,639
hand

355
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,040
they want things to work out not the way

356
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,079
they expected

357
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,480
because that's the way we get clues into

358
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,839
what new physics

359
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,240
is still out there to be discovered i

360
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,399
guess for now we'll have to be content

361
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,279
with being right

362
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,200
hey this video was sponsored by kiwiko

363
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,000
which i'm really

364
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,680
excited about because i've been using

365
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,360
their monthly crates since the beginning

366
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,519
of the year with my four-year-old he got

367
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,959
it as a christmas present

368
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,560
and i've got to say they have been a

369
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
great resource for learning at home

370
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,120
each crate has super cool hands-on

371
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,040
projects that are fun to make and

372
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,360
they expose kids to steam concepts

373
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,880
that's science technology

374
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,839
engineering art and math now each box

375
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,839
includes all the supplies needed meaning

376
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,639
no extra trips to the store and kiwi co

377
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,040
offers

378
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,959
eight subscription lines for different

379
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,320
age groups and topics

380
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,800
they sent me some of the older age group

381
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,360
crates to try out and i had a lot of fun

382
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,240
uh making this this is a planetarium and

383
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,000
something you might not know is kiwico

384
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,079
is not only a subscription service you

385
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,680
can browse their store and purchase

386
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,920
individual projects or value packs for

387
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,880
different ages

388
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,040
no subscription required so let's talk

389
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,519
about why kiwico is so useful right now

390
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,200
i mean anyone who has been at home with

391
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,720
kids over the past few months

392
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,240
knows just how important it is to get

393
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,160
them engaged in something other than

394
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,800
a screen the summer brain drain happens

395
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,760
every year but

396
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,320
it is especially challenging right now

397
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,079
with disruptions to school and

398
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,760
online learning just not being as good

399
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,160
as you know in in-person hands-on

400
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,800
learning

401
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,320
now what i know from my own experience

402
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,480
is my son loves making kiwico projects

403
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,240
with me

404
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,839
he has a lot of fun and doesn't even

405
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,360
realize he's learning what do you see

406
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,959
you know one day we will talk about the

407
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,800
missing baryons but for right now these

408
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,360
projects

409
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,279
are a great way for us to connect and

410
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,199
learn together so if you want to try it

411
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,240
