2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,560
More about last pass at the end of the show.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,280
The butter fly effect is the idea that the tiny causes, like a flay of a butter fly's wings in Brazil,

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,160
can have huge effects, like setting off a tornado in Texas

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,040
Now that idea comes straight from the title of a scientific paper published nearly 50 years ago

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,560
and perhaps more than any other recent scientific concept, it has captured the public imagination

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,600
I mean on IMDB there is not one but 61

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,480
different movies, TV episodes, and short films with 'butterfly effect' in the title

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,400
not to mention prominent references in movies like Jurassic Park, or in songs, books, and memes.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,080
Oh the memes

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,800
in pop culture the butterfly effect has come to mean

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,240
that even tiny, seemingly insignificant choices you make can have huge consequences later on in your life

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,560
and I think the reason people are so fascinated by the butterfly effect is because it gets at a fundamental question

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,040
Which is, how well can we predict the future?

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,680
Now the goal of this video is to answer that question by examining the science behind the butterfly effect

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:13,080
so if you go back to the late 1600s, after Isaac Newton had come up with his laws of motion and universal gravitation,

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,080
everything seemed predictable.

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,480
I mean we could explain the motions of all the planets and moons,

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,960
we could predict eclipses and the appearances of comets with pinpoint accuracy centuries in advance

20
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,240
French physicist Pierre-Simon Laplace summed it up in a famous thought experiment:

21
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,400
he imagined a super-intelligent being, now called Laplace's demon,

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,560
that knew everything about the current state of the universe:

23
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,040
the positions and momenta of all the particles and how they interact

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,400
if this intellect were vast enough to submit the data to analysis, he concluded,

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,120
then the future, just like the past, would be present before its eyes

26
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,520
This is total determinism: the view that the future is already fixed,

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,000
We just have to wait for it to manifest itself

28
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,680
I think if you've studied a bit of physics, this is the natural viewpoint to come away with

29
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,200
I mean sure there's Heisenberg's uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics,

30
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,800
but that's on the scale of atoms;

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,280
Pretty insignificant on the scale of people.

32
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,920
Virtually all the problems I studied were ones that could be solved analytically

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,840
like the motion of planets, or falling objects, or pendulums

34
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,960
and speaking of pendulums I want to look at a case of a simple pendulum here

35
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,080
to introduce an important representation of dynamical systems, which is phase space

36
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,000
so some people may be familiar with position-time or velocity-time graphs

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,880
but what if we wanted to make a 2d plot that represents every possible state of the pendulum?

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,800
Every possible thing it could do in one graph

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,920
well on the x-axis we can plot the angle of the pendulum,

40
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,080
and on the y-axis its velocity.

41
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,320
And this is what's called phase space.

42
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,000
If the pendulum has friction it will eventually slow down and stop

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,280
and this is shown in phase space by the inward spiral --

44
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,160
the pendulum swings slower and less far each time

45
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,040
and it doesn't really matter what the initial conditions are,

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,400
we know that the final state will be the pendulum at rest hanging straight down

47
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,640
and from the graph it looks like the system is attracted to the origin, that one fixed point

48
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,120
so this is called a fixed point attractor

49
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,040
now if the pendulum doesn't lose energy, well it swings back and forth the same way each time

50
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,200
and in phase space we get a loop

51
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,200
the pendulum is going fastest at the bottom but the swing is in opposite directions as it goes back and forth

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,240
the closed loop tells us the motion is periodic and predictable

53
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,440
anytime you see an image like this in phase space,

54
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,160
you know that this system regularly repeats

55
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,600
we can swing the pendulum with different amplitudes,

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,880
but the picture in phase space is very similar, just a different sized loop

57
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,240
now an important thing to note is that the curves never cross in phase space

58
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,600
and that's because each point uniquely identifies the complete state of the system

59
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,120
and that state has only one future

60
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,360
so once you've defined the initial state, the entire future is determined

61
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,200
now the pendulum can be well understood using Newtonian physics,

62
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,240
but Newton himself was aware of problems that did not submit to his equations so easily,

63
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,480
particularly the three-body problem.

64
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,160
so calculating the motion of the Earth around the Sun was simple enough with just those two bodies

65
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,640
but add in one more, say the moon,

66
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,959
and it became virtually impossible

67
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,720
Newton told his friend Haley that the theory of the motions of the moon made his head ache,

68
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,440
and kept him awake so often that he would think of it no more

69
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,600
the problem, as would become clear to Henri Poincaré two hundred years later,

70
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,080
was that there was no simple solution to the three-body problem

71
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,040
Poincaré had glimpsed what later became known as chaos.

72
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,280
Chaos really came into focus in the 1960s,

73
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,040
when meteorologist Ed Lorenz tried to make a basic computer simulation of the Earth's atmosphere

74
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,680
he had 12 equations and 12 variables, things like temperature, pressure, humidity and so on

75
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,560
and the computer would print out each time step as a row of 12 numbers

76
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,160
so you could watch how they evolved over time

77
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,760
now the breakthrough came when Lorenz wanted to redo a run

78
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,400
but as a shortcut he entered the numbers from halfway through a previous printout

79
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,560
and then he set the computer calculating

80
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,040
he went off to get some coffee, and when he came back and saw the results,

81
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,840
Lorenz was stunned.

82
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,160
The new run followed the old one for a short while but then it diverged

83
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,720
and pretty soon it was describing a totally different state of the atmosphere

84
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,840
I mean totally different weather

85
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,840
Lorenz's first thought, of course, was that the computer had broken

86
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,600
Maybe a vacuum tube had blown.

87
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,720
But none had.

88
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,600
The real reason for the difference came down to the fact that printer rounded to three decimal places

89
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,080
whereas the computer calculated with six

90
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,760
So when he entered those initial conditions,

91
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,520
the difference of less than one part in a thousand

92
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,920
created totally different weather just a short time into the future

93
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,760
now Lorenz tried simplifying his equations and then simplifying them some more,

94
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,800
down to just three equations and three variables

95
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,400
which represented a toy model of convection:

96
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,840
essentially a 2d slice of the atmosphere heated at the bottom and cooled at the top

97
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,720
but again, he got the same type of behavior:

98
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,520
if he changed the numbers just a tiny bit, results diverged dramatically.

99
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,560
Lorenz's system displayed what's become known as sensitive dependence on initial conditions,

100
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,680
which is the hallmark of chaos

101
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,640
now since Lorenz was working with three variables, we can plot the phase space of his system in three dimensions

102
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,840
We can pick any point as our initial state and watch how it evolves.

103
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,280
Does our point move toward a fixed attractor?

104
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,440
Or a repeating loop?

105
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,680
It doesn't seem to

106
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,040
In truth, our system will never revisit the same exact state again.

107
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,440
Here I actually started with three closely spaced initial states,

108
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,880
and they've been evolving together so far, but now they're starting to diverge

109
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,840
From being arbitrarily close together, they end up on totally different trajectories.

110
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,040
This is sensitive dependence on initial conditions in action.

111
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,680
Now I should point out that there is nothing random at all about this system of equations.

112
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,800
It's completely deterministic, just like the pendulum

113
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,920
so if you could input exactly the same initial conditions

114
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,520
you would get exactly the same result

115
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,520
the problem is, unlike the pendulum, this system is chaotic

116
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,280
so any difference in initial conditions, no matter how tiny,

117
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,680
will be amplified to a totally different final state

118
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,480
It seems like a paradox, but this system is both deterministic and unpredictable

119
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,520
because in practice, you could never know the initial conditions with perfect accuracy,

120
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,200
and I'm talking infinite decimal places.

121
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,080
But the result suggests why even today with huge supercomputers,

122
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,840
it's so hard to forecast the weather more than a week in advance

123
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,040
In fact, studies have shown that by the eighth day of a long-range forecast,

124
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:03,280
the prediction is less accurate than if you just took the historical average conditions for that day

125
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,360
and knowing about chaos, meteorologists no longer make just a single forecast

126
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,240
instead they make ensemble forecasts,

127
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,880
varying initial conditions and model parameters

128
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,680
to create a set of predictions.

129
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,560
Now far from being the exception to the rule, chaotic systems have been turning up everywhere.

130
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,600
The double pendulum, just two simple pendulums connected together, is chaotic

131
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,800
here two double pendulums have been released simultaneously

132
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,760
with almost the same initial conditions

133
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,159
but no matter how hard you try,

134
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,679
you could never release a double pendulum and make it behave the same way twice.

135
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,239
its motion will forever be unpredictable

136
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,800
you might think that chaos always requires a lot of energy or irregular motions,

137
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,920
but this system of five fidgets spinners with repelling magnets in each of their arms is chaotic too

138
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,000
At first glance the system seems to repeat regularly,

139
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,320
but if you watch more closely, you'll notice some strange motions

140
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,520
a spinner suddenly flips the other way

141
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,640
Even our solar system is not predictable

142
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,080
a study simulating our solar system for a hundred million years into the future

143
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,200
found its behavior as a whole to be chaotic

144
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,760
with a characteristic time of about four million years

145
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,400
that means within say 10 or 15 million years,

146
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,520
some planets or moons may have collided or been flung out of the solar system entirely.

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,600
The very system we think of as the model of order,

148
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,080
is unpredictable on even modest timescales

149
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,560
So how well can we predict the future?

150
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,600
Not very well at all at least when it comes to chaotic systems

151
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,080
The further into the future you try to predict the harder it becomes

152
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,280
and past a certain point, predictions are no better than guesses.

153
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:56,240
The same is true when looking into the past of chaotic systems and trying to identify initial causes

154
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,800
I think of it kind of like a fog that sets in the further we try to look into the future or into the past

155
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,880
Chaos puts fundamental limits on what we can know about the future of systems

156
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,920
and what we can say about their past

157
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,480
But there is a silver lining

158
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,320
Let's look again at the phase space of Lorenz's equations

159
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,640
If we start with a whole bunch of different initial conditions and watch them evolve,

160
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,800
initially the motion is messy.

161
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,680
But soon all the points have moved towards or onto an object

162
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,120
the object, coincidentally, looks a bit like a butterfly.

163
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,840
it is the attractor

164
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:36,240
For a large range of initial conditions, the system evolves into a state on this attractor

165
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,320
Now remember: all the paths traced out here never cross and they never connect to form a loop,

166
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:47,280
If they did then they would continue on that loop forever and the behavior would be periodic and predictable

167
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,560
so each path here is actually an infinite curve in a finite space.

168
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,240
But how is that possible?

169
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,880
Fractals. But that's a story for another video

170
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,680
this particular attractor is called the Lorenz attractor,

171
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,560
Probably the most famous example of a chaotic attractor

172
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,120
though many others have been found for other systems of equations

173
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,480
now if people have heard anything about the butterfly effect,

174
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,560
it's usually about how tiny causes make the future unpredictable

175
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:19,480
but the science behind the butterfly effect also reveals a deep and beautiful structure underlying the dynamics

176
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,520
One that can provide useful insights into the behavior of a system

177
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,040
So you can't predict how any individual state will evolve,

178
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,360
but you can say how a collection of states evolves

179
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,360
and, at least in the case of Lorenz's equations,

180
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,880
they take the shape of a butterfly

181
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,040
Hey this part of the video is sponsored by LastPass,

182
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,480
the password manager with unlimited password storage and free cross-device sync

183
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,880
before I used a password manager, I've got to admit, I used the same password for a lot of different accounts

184
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,640
and I know that is incredibly dangerous because if even one of those sites got hacked,

185
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,800
then all of my important accounts would be exposed

186
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,960
Quite the butterfly effect.

187
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,440
LastPass auto generates strong passwords for you

188
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,000
so you have a different, indecipherable code for each website

189
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,360
and let's face it: if there's anything in your life that you want to be chaotic,

190
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,040
it is the characters in your passwords

191
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,240
the best part is because it autofills user names and passwords on websites

192
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,280
or on iOS or Android apps and mobile sites,

193
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,160
you never have to remember another password again. Not for the rest of your life

194
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,640
and that means no more writing down passwords, no more getting locked out of accounts,

195
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,800
no more password resets. You can use your brain for what it's meant to be doing.

196
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,400
and if you want extra features like advanced multi-factor authentication,

197
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,640
you can upgrade to LastPass premium

198
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,280
I got to say, it works like magic.

199
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,120
so put your passwords on autopilot with LastPass
