according to the general theory of

relativity gravity is not a force

there are no gravitational fields

gravity

is kind of an illusion and in this video

i will prove it to you by blasting off

into outer space

in three two one

[Music]

albert einstein said the happiest

thought of his life

was imagining a man falling off the roof

of a house

what made einstein so happy about this

wasn't shot in freuda

it was the realization that this man

while he was falling

wouldn't feel his own weight he would be

weightless

and anything he dropped on his way down

well it would remain stationary relative

to him

or moving in uniform motion

the whole situation would be just

like if you were in deep space

not near any large masses

with your spaceship at rest or coasting

along at constant velocity

here you would feel no weight

objects would remain stationary relative

to you

or if you give them a push they would

move in a straight line at constant

velocity

and you would be the very definition of

an inertial observer

you're not accelerating not in a

gravitational field

all the laws of physics apply in your

reference frame

meaning there is no experiment you could

do to distinguish

your inertial reference frame from any

other

now here comes the big leap einstein

looks at these two scenarios and says

they are equivalent not just similar

physically they are exactly the same

thing which means

man falling from roof is not in a

gravitational field there are no

gravitational fields

and he is not accelerating he is an

inertial observer

just like rocket man whoa whoa whoa

i mean okay i can see how both of these

observers

feel weightless but man falling from

roof is clearly in a gravitational field

i mean he's right

next to the earth and he's obviously

accelerating

his speed is increasing by 9.8 meters

per second every second a fact

that will become painfully apparent when

he crashes into the ground

i know that these two situations look

very different

but einstein's equivalence principle

tells us the one

thing to focus on the experience of the

observer

if they feel weightless then they are in

an inertial frame of reference

every bit as good as rocket man's out

drifting through deep space

imagine if rocket man coasting along at

constant velocity

and not paying attention comes upon a

planet a long way off in the distance

[Music]

an external observer might notice that

the path of the rocket bends ever so

slightly towards the planet

but inside rocket man would remain

oblivious

he feels no force experiences no

acceleration

as the rocket gets closer to the planet

it goes faster and faster

but rocketman still feels weightless for

him nothing has changed

so where on this journey would you say

the frame of reference changes from

inertial to non-inertial

an on-board accelerometer would never

even register a blip

he has continued on his inertial path

through space-time

so the logical conclusion is his frame

of reference is inertial up until the

instant he crashes into the planet

okay so how do you explain the curved

path of his rocket without

gravitational forces or gravitational

fields the answer

is curved space time first focus on

rocketman's observation that the whole

time

he felt like he was moving with constant

velocity in a straight

line he was moving in a straight line

through space-time

but space-time around massive objects

like planets is curved

so that's why his path appeared curved

to a distant observer

now this isn't as unusual as it seems

airplanes for example always try to fly

the shortest route between cities

essentially they just go in a straight

line but since the earth's surface is

curved the shortest path

doesn't look like a straight line these

shortest paths over curved surfaces

are called geodesics and we use that

same word

geodesics for the straight line paths

followed by inertial observers through

curved spacetime

here's another analogy imagine you and a

friend

are standing a thousand kilometers apart

on the equator

now you both set off due north over time

you will come closer together ultimately

bumping into each other at the north

pole

it's as though there was a force pushing

you together

but you didn't feel a force and your

friend didn't feel a force

gravity is just like that force it

doesn't actually

exist the real reason for you coming

together

was that you were both on straight paths

geodesics

on a curved surface

astronauts on the space station are

weightless

that means they too are inertial

observers traveling on a geodesic

but the earth curves space-time around

it

which is why their straight-line path

appears as a helix

it only looks like a circular orbit if

you forget the time dimension

don't forget we are all moving through

space and time

space time

this is the standard bent sheet analogy

for

curved space-time but i think this demo

is misleading

it allows you to fool yourself into

thinking you understand general

relativity

when the intuition you're actually

drawing on is just that

objects like to fall towards the middle

of a well

due to the gravitational force but in

general relativity

there is no gravitational force what you

should be thinking about is

objects traveling on a straight line

path through space-time

it just so happens that space-time is

curved around massive

objects so that straight-line path

doesn't look like a straight line

matter tells space time how to curve and

space time tells matter how to move

now let's go back to deep space what

happens

if you turn on the rocket thrusters and

accelerate

at 9.8 meters per second squared

well someone outside would see all

objects remain

stationary while the floor of the rocket

accelerates

into them

[Music]

inside the rocket everything would

appear to accelerate down to the ground

and you would feel a force pushing up on

your feet

the same force that's pushing up on you

as you watch this video

this situation feels exactly the same as

being at rest

on the surface of earth

because we are at rest on the surface of

earth

now i want to ask you are you watching

this video in an inertial frame of

reference

well i mean do you feel weightless

no so you are not an inertial observer

your situation is exactly the same as

someone accelerating

on a rocket ship in deep space and let

me be clear i don't mean

that being at rest in a gravitational

field is like accelerating in a rocket

i mean it is the exact same thing you

are accelerating and there is no

gravitational field

gravitational fields do not exist now i

know that sounds crazy

but come with me for a minute

this is you in standard newtonian

physics

we draw your weight force the force of

gravity

pushing you down and the normal force

from the floor pushing you up

we say these forces are equal and

opposite so there's no net force on you

so you are not

accelerating but in general relativity

gravity is not a force you have

no weight so the only force on you are

these normal forces pushing you up

so you are accelerating upwards but i'm

not

moving up relative to what i mean

relative to the flip chart and the floor

and basically everything in this room

but all of those things are in your

frame of reference which you know is not

inertial

relative to everything in my rocket ship

i'm not accelerating

what you need if you really want to

measure your acceleration

is someone in an inertial frame of

reference like the guy who fell off the

roof

and he would see you accelerating up at

9.8

meters per second squared i think

what this shows is that what an

acceleration really is

is it's a deviation from a geodesic

you can't follow a straight-line path

through space-time

because the floor prevents you from

doing that it applies a force upwards on

you

so you're accelerating up but if i'm

accelerating up

and so is everyone else around the world

and presumably the whole surface of the

earth

then shouldn't the earth be expanding

no it is possible for you to be

accelerating

even though your spatial coordinates are

not changing

i will show you one equation from

general relativity

this says that the second derivative of

your position with respect to time

is equal to your acceleration that's

just f

on m and if you were in flat space time

well this is exactly what you're saying

if you're accelerating your spatial

coordinates have to change

but you're not in flat space time and

this term is related to the curvature of

space time

and this is your velocity through time

squared

you don't have to worry about the

details here the point

is your position can be not changing

this

can be zero which means your

acceleration

must be exactly equal to this

this curvature term times your velocity

through time

squared so in curved space time

you need to accelerate just to stand

still

a lot of this may seem more complicated

than newtonian physics but

one classical mystery looks a whole lot

simpler in general relativity

which is why all objects fall at the

same rate

now i have made a number of videos on

this topic and

i would always give the standard

newtonian explanation the only force on

a free-falling body is its weight

gmm on r squared which equals its mass

times acceleration

you can cancel the object's mass on both

sides of the equation

hence all objects will have this same

acceleration

the mystery is why we could cancel these

two

m's the one on the left was

gravitational mass the property of an

object

that creates and experiences a

gravitational field

while the m on the right is inertial

mass a measure of

resistance to acceleration why should

these two

conceptually different properties be

numerically

identical scientists have spent a lot of

time and effort

experimentally testing down to around

one part in 10 trillion

that these two types of mass really are

the same

but in general relativity there is no

mystery

all objects appear to fall the same way

because they're not

accelerating they're just following

straight-line paths through space-time

until they encounter something that

stops them

like the objects in the rocket ship they

appear to accelerate at the same rate

because

they're not really accelerating it's the

floor accelerating

into them now a lot of this might seem

pretty far-fetched as it did back in

1915 when einstein proposed it

so he very cleverly came up with a

measurable prediction that scientists

could make to test his theory

imagine that this rocket ship is

coasting through deep space

if you shine a light beam across the

rocket ship

well it'll do exactly what you expect

light travels in a straight line

and hits a point on the opposite wall at

exactly the same height as the source

but now what if this rocket is

accelerating

well to an external observer they're

still going to see the same thing

light traveling in a straight line but

inside the rocket

during the time it takes for the light

to travel across the cabin

the rocket will have sped up so by the

time it hits the other wall

it'll hit a little lower than before

so in an accelerating frame of reference

light

deflects down here i am dramatically

exaggerating the effect

even if i were accelerating up at 10 g's

which would

probably kill me the deflection would be

on the order of the width of a proton

still it shows that an accelerating

frame of reference

will bend light so einstein reasoned

light must also bend when it passes a

large

mass but where do you find a mass large

enough

well the only obvious huge mass near the

earth is the sun

so the ideal experiment would be to look

at light passing just

next to the sun and see if it is

deflected

say light from distant stars the problem

was of course the sun is just so bright

you can't see stars right next to it

unless there is a total solar eclipse

which is exactly what happened in 1919

so arthur eddington set out

to take pictures of the stars right next

to the sun

during totality and what he found by

analyzing those pictures was that their

positions

appeared deflected by the precise amount

predicted by einstein's general theory

of relativity

the result was twice the deflection some

had calculated using a strictly

newtonian model

in general relativity has passed

virtually every test

put to it over the past hundred years or

so but there are still

more things to try

[Music]

a well-known and empirically validated

finding

is that accelerating charges radiate

electromagnetic radiation

so one conceptually simple experimental

test

would be to compare the behavior of a

stationary charge in a gravitational

field to

a free falling one if a more newtonian

picture of gravity is correct

well then the stationary charge should

not radiate electromagnetic radiation

but a free falling one is accelerating

and therefore it should radiate

in contrast general relativity sees the

free falling charge as

non-accelerating it's just going on a

straight line path through curved

space-time

whereas the stationary charge is

accelerating and therefore

it should give off electromagnetic

radiation

now thus far logistical challenges have

prevented anyone from actually carrying

out this experiment

but what you believe will happen reveals

what you truly think

about the nature of gravity do you think

that a freely falling charge will

radiate electromagnetic radiation

or not is gravity an illusion

this episode was sponsored by caseta and

so i used the sponsorship money

to have a rocket ship built

caseta by lutron makes these smart light

switches in the rocket ship

they also make remotes motion sensors

smart plugs basically

every smart switch you could use for

turning things in your home on and

off but installing a smart switch isn't

rocket science

just turn off the power to the switch

detach the existing wires

and reconnect them to the caseta smart

switch what's great about smart switches

as opposed to smart bulbs

is one switch often controls multiple

bulbs

so you can save money by replacing only

the switch and they connect to most

smart devices like alexa google

assistant

and apple home kit and you can control

them via an

app on your phone so if you forget to

turn off the lights in the rocket

no need to go back just turn them off in

the app you can also use the app to set

up schedules

turning the lights on when it goes dark

this gives you peace of mind knowing

your family will always come home to a

well-lit house

now we may not have personal rockets yet

but we have smart switches and the smart

choice for these devices
