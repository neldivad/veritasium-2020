[Music]

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,200
the first piece of evidence that showed

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,200
our universe is expanding

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,160
came in the light from distant galaxies

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,079
if you look at the spectrum of the sun

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,400
you see these dark lines and we see

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,760
those same lines

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,920
in the spectra from galaxies except

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,880
they're shifted

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,359
to longer wavelengths towards the red

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,800
end of the spectrum

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,039
so we say their light is red-shifted

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,960
now the usual explanation for this

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,040
redshift is that as the light is

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,360
traveling through expanding space

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,480
the photons themselves become stretched

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,600
so short wavelengths get longer and this

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,320
is known as cosmological redshift the

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,239
explanation is fairly intuitively

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,000
satisfying and most people go on without

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,680
giving it a second thought

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,760
but the problem is if you do give it a

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,360
second thought you think

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,440
well if expanding space can stretch

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,680
something like a photon something that's

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,440
so incredibly tiny does it also stretch

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,640
atoms and molecules is expanding

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,640
space stretching stars and galaxies

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,520
and what about you are you expanding

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,320
with the universe

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,040
to answer these questions we've got to

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,960
take a closer look at what it really

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,840
means to

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,640
redshift physicists actually talk about

38
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
three different types of redshift

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,720
doppler redshift where observers moving

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,840
relative to one another

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,280
measure photons to have different

42
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,840
wavelengths gravitational redshift where

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,520
observers at different locations in a

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,799
gravitational field

45
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,880
measure different wavelengths and

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,040
cosmological redshift where observers

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,479
exchanging photons over

48
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,040
vast cosmological distances in an

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,560
expanding universe

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,720
measure different wavelengths these

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,680
three cases

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,600
appear very different and they're

53
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
governed by different equations

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,520
so how does each redshift actually occur

55
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,119
let's start with a photon in a

56
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,640
gravitational field

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,479
there is this famous experiment

58
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,439
conducted in 1959 by pound and rebka

59
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,160
sending photons up and down a 22 meter

60
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,520
tower at harvard

61
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,280
now they used gamma rays but all

62
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,920
represent them with visible light

63
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,160
they found that photons detected at the

64
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,200
top of the tower

65
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,599
were redshifted relative to the source

66
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,879
by the exact amount

67
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,920
predicted by general relativity which

68
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,319
is a tiny amount i'm dramatically

69
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,400
exaggerating the effect just so you can

70
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,440
see it

71
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,599
now where along the photons path does

72
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,920
this redshift take place

73
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,720
well it seems to happen continuously the

74
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,840
photon loses

75
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,160
a little bit of energy each millimeter

76
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,360
it climbs

77
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,160
up that tower meaning that the photon in

78
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,360
the middle of the tower

79
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,239
would appear green now according to

80
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,080
einstein's equivalence principle

81
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,640
being at rest on earth's surface is

82
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,400
indistinguishable from being

83
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,800
in a rocket in deep space accelerating

84
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,840
up at one

85
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,879
g so we could do the same experiment

86
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,959
in a rocket ship and we should get the

87
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,400
same result

88
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,959
if we send blue photons from the back of

89
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:07,680
the rocket

90
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,760
they should be red when they reach the

91
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
front and in the middle of the ship they

92
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,560
would appear

93
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,959
green this is exactly what we saw at

94
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,879
rest in a gravitational field so

95
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,840
the equivalence principle holds now

96
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,400
imagine

97
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,360
there are a line of external observers

98
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,840
just

99
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,560
hanging out in space at rest relative to

100
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,360
each other

101
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,000
and they can all see into the rocket

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,920
let's also say the rocket is initially

103
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,799
at rest

104
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,959
and the thrusters are switched on the

105
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,080
instant the photon

106
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,720
is released now since both observers are

107
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,840
at rest at this moment

108
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,440
they will both measure the photon as

109
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,040
having the exact same wavelength

110
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,519
it's blue but what about when the photon

111
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,360
reaches the middle of the rocket

112
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,519
well we know someone inside will see it

113
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,560
as green

114
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,720
but what about a stationary observer

115
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,760
outside

116
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,840
well to them the photon has just been

117
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,680
moving through ordinary flat

118
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,720
space-time so it must look blue

119
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,480
just as blue as it was when it was

120
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,840
emitted

121
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,319
so what's the deal how can the same

122
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,120
photon

123
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,640
look green and blue at the same time

124
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,319
has the equivalence principle been

125
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,480
violated the answer

126
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,199
is no it matters a lot to this

127
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:17,759
measurement

128
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,478
who is doing the observation consider

129
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,358
this

130
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,440
after the photon is emitted the rocket

131
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,479
accelerates it's

132
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,800
speeding up so by the time the photon

133
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
reaches the middle of the rocket

134
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,960
everyone inside is now moving at high

135
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,840
velocity

136
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,440
relative to the source when the light

137
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
was emitted and relative to the

138
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,360
observers outside the rocket

139
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
so it makes sense that the photon as

140
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,960
measured inside will look different

141
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,520
it'll be

142
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,400
redshifted this is the doppler redshift

143
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,960
because

144
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,560
the observer in the middle of the ship

145
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,800
is moving very quickly away from the

146
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,680
source

147
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,280
by the time the photon makes it to the

148
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,120
top of the rocket well the rocket will

149
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,919
be going even

150
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,040
faster and this is why it appears red

151
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,199
but to a stationary observer outside

152
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,320
well it still

153
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,080
looks blue this thought experiment

154
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,639
shows us that wavelength and energy are

155
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,400
not intrinsic properties

156
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,639
of photons they are properties of the

157
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,520
photon observer system

158
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,160
now let's recreate the harvard tower

159
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,199
experiment

160
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,199
observers in the building see the photon

161
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,520
redshifted as it climbs

162
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,600
but here's a question for you what would

163
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,520
a free-falling observer

164
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,039
see well they would be just like

165
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,800
the stationary observers in space

166
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,280
watching the rocket accelerate up

167
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,280
the physics of these two situations are

168
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,639
identical so

169
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,919
they would measure no redshift to them

170
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,240
the photon would look blue the whole

171
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,199
time

172
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,520
what i want to show is that there aren't

173
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,880
actually three different types of

174
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,080
redshifts there is

175
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,000
only one we've seen that the

176
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,440
gravitational redshift can

177
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,680
equivalently be seen as a doppler red

178
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
shift when we do the same analysis

179
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,560
in an accelerating rocket ship so what

180
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,039
about

181
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,080
cosmological redshift well for this we

182
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,039
have to zoom

183
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,240
way out past our solar system

184
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,440
the milky way galaxy our local cluster

185
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,560
of galaxies

186
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,720
we want to zoom so far out that the

187
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,039
galaxies in the observable universe

188
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,160
are like molecules in a fluid the

189
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,840
cosmic fluid at this scale we can treat

190
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,360
the whole universe as being

191
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,479
smooth and uniform cosmologists say it

192
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,000
is homogeneous

193
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
and just as you don't notice the

194
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,759
individual molecules in a cup of water

195
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,000
at this scale we don't notice the

196
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,560
individual galaxies in the cosmic fluid

197
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,800
and the cosmic fluid looks the same in

198
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,080
every direction

199
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,960
there is no preferred orientation it's

200
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,600
said to be

201
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,800
isotropic now what you'll notice is that

202
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,400
the cosmic fluid is

203
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,880
spreading out it doesn't matter where

204
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,599
you look

205
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,720
you see the same thing things moving

206
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,759
apart

207
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,919
the density of the cosmic fluid is

208
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,800
decreasing

209
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,319
over time and this is the basic property

210
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,400
of an expanding universe

211
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,319
we can draw some coordinates on the

212
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,680
universe we could pick

213
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,000
any different coordinate system we like

214
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,759
but one way it's often done

215
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,520
is to make a coordinate system that

216
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,560
expands with the cosmic fluid

217
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,960
so there will be certain observers whose

218
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,680
coordinates

219
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,560
don't change over time and these are

220
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,440
known as

221
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,800
co-moving observers they are at rest

222
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,120
with respect to the cosmic fluid

223
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,599
by the way on earth we are not a

224
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,680
co-moving observer our galaxy is moving

225
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,919
at 600 kilometers per second

226
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,759
relative to the cosmic microwave

227
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,360
background radiation

228
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,000
now let's pick two co-moving observers a

229
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,520
large distance apart

230
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,319
and have them exchange a photon its

231
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,160
wavelength will be stretched by the

232
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
amount the universe has expanded

233
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,800
during the photons journey this is the

234
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,560
standard picture of cosmological

235
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,759
redshift

236
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,840
but now consider a bunch of other

237
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,919
co-moving observers along the path of

238
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,360
this photon

239
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,680
each one absorbs the photon and

240
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,440
instantaneously emits another

241
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,680
identical to the one they measured now

242
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,440
each successive observer

243
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,120
will measure a slightly longer

244
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,520
wavelength than the observer before them

245
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,360
the photons stretching out just as you'd

246
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,000
expect in an expanding universe

247
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,240
but the reason they would give for this

248
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,400
redshift would be different

249
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,879
to each observer their neighboring

250
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,160
co-moving observers

251
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,240
would appear to be moving away from them

252
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,720
in locally flat space time

253
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,719
so they would attribute the increase in

254
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,640
wavelength to the doppler shift

255
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,479
just due to the relative motion between

256
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,080
them the

257
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,719
entirety of the cosmological redshift

258
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,519
then

259
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,919
can equivalently be thought of as the

260
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,200
result of a long

261
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,800
series of doppler shifts

262
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,480
what we've seen is redshifting is not

263
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,080
something that happens to a photon

264
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,240
itself instead it depends on what's

265
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,839
happening to observers at the point of

266
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,480
emission

267
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,040
and absorption of that photon and

268
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,000
because of this

269
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
there are actually not three different

270
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,279
types of redshift there's only one

271
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,519
described by a single underlying

272
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,880
mathematical framework

273
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
they only look different depending on

274
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,560
your frame of reference

275
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,880
now it can be convenient to talk about

276
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,640
expanding space when you have

277
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,480
two co-moving observers exchanging a

278
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,399
photon over vast distances in

279
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,640
an expanding universe then the photon's

280
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,680
wavelength is just

281
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,519
stretched by the amount the universe

282
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,800
expanded during its journey

283
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,200
that's nice and simple but you can

284
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,279
equally well describe the redshift by

285
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,600
a long chain of doppler shifts no

286
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,310
expanding space required

287
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,240
[Music]

288
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,320
the misconception is to think that

289
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,800
because photons are red-shifted as they

290
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,480
travel across the universe

291
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,600
that means expanding space is pulling on

292
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,000
things

293
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,560
and stretching things apart that's not

294
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,839
how it works space

295
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,320
is not like that so let's come back to

296
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,399
the central question of this video which

297
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:58,880
is

298
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,600
do you expand with the universe the

299
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,560
answer

300
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,800
is no because on the scale of people

301
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,519
the universe is not homogeneous i mean

302
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,760
matter is condensed down into objects in

303
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,040
the earth

304
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,079
and the universe is not isotropic

305
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,800
looking up looks decidedly different

306
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,200
from

307
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,200
looking down the basic assumptions we

308
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,839
made

309
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,000
about our expanding universe just don't

310
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,360
apply here

311
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,519
i mean the local space-time curvature is

312
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,800
dominated by

313
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,839
the earth so what if we took you out

314
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,040
into deep space

315
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,519
the middle of nowhere then would you

316
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,880
expand

317
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,440
still no because your body is held

318
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,320
together by

319
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,800
electromagnetic forces but what if we

320
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,079
could turn off

321
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,000
the electromagnetic force so your body

322
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,640
is just a jumble of particles that don't

323
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,079
interact

324
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,600
well in that case over time you

325
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,800
would expand but only because our

326
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,760
universe is now dominated by dark energy

327
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,079
so the take-home message of this video

328
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,800
is that red-shifting photons don't mean

329
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,519
that space is expanding and pulling on

330
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,120
everything stretching things apart

331
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,279
so molecules are not expanding and

332
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,640
neither are stars

333
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,959
and neither are galaxies and neither are

334
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:17,680
you

335
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,760
except for very extraordinary

336
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,480
circumstances

337
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,839
that tells you it's recording here we go

338
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,600
hey this portion of the video was
