of the show the butterfly effect is the

idea that tiny causes like a flap of a

butterfly's wings in Brazil can have

huge effects like setting off a tornado

in Texas now that idea comes straight

from the title of a scientific paper

published nearly 50 years ago and

perhaps more than any other recent

scientific concept it has captured the

public imagination I mean on IMDB there

is not one but 61 different movies TV

episodes and short films with butterfly

effect in the title not to mention

prominent references in movies like

Jurassic Park

or in songs books and memes oh the memes

in pop culture the butterfly effect has

come to mean that even tiny seemingly

insignificant choices you make can have

huge consequences later on in your life

and I think the reason people are so

fascinated by the butterfly effect is

because it gets at a fundamental

question which is how well can we

predict the future now the goal of this

video is to answer that question by

examining the science behind the

butterfly effect so if you go back to

the late 1600s after Isaac Newton had

come up with his laws of motion and

universal gravitation everything seemed

predictable I mean we could explain the

motions of all the planets and moons we

could predict eclipses and the

appearances of comets with pinpoint

accuracy centuries in advance French

physicist pierre-simon Laplace summed it

up in a famous thought experiment he

imagined a super-intelligent being now

called Laplace's demon that knew

everything about the current state of

the universe the positions and momenta

of all the particles and how they

interact

if this intellect were vast enough to

submit the data to analysis he concluded

then the future just like the past would

be present before its eyes this is total

determinism the view that the future is

already fixed we just have to wait for

it to manifest itself I think if you've

studied a bit of physics this is the

natural viewpoint to come away with

I mean sure there's Heisenberg's

uncertainty principle from quantum

mechanics but that's on the scale of

atoms pretty insignificant on the scale

of people virtually all the problems

I studied were ones that could be solved

analytically like the motion of planets

or falling objects or pendulums and

speaking of pendulums I want to look at

a case of a simple pendulum here to

introduce an important representation of

dynamical systems which is phase space

so some people may be familiar with

position time or velocity time graphs

but what if we wanted to make a 2d plot

that represents every possible state of

the pendulum every possible thing it

could do in one graph well on the x-axis

we can plot the angle of the pendulum

and on the y-axis its velocity and this

is what's called phase space if the

pendulum has friction it will eventually

slow down and stop and this is shown in

phase space by the inward spiral the

pendulum swings slower and less far each

time and it doesn't really matter what

the initial conditions are we know that

the final state will be the pendulum at

rest hanging straight down and from the

graph it looks like the system is

attracted to the origin that one fixed

point so this is called a fixed point

attractor now if the pendulum doesn't

lose energy well it swings back and

forth the same way each time and in

phase space we get a loop the pendulum

is going fastest at the bottom but the

swing is in opposite directions as it

goes back and forth the closed loop

tells us the motion is periodic and

predictable anytime you see an image

like this in phase space you know that

this system regularly repeats we can

swing the pendulum with different

amplitudes but the picture in phase bass

is very similar just a different sized

loop now an important thing to note is

that the curves never cross in phase

space and that's because each point

uniquely identifies the complete state

of the system and that state has only

one future so once you've defined the

initial state the entire future is

determined now the pendulum can be well

understood using Newtonian physics but

Newton himself was aware of problems

that did not submit to his equations so

easily particularly the three-body

problem so calculating the motion of the

earth around the Sun was simple enough

with just those two bodies but add in

one more say the moon and it became

virtually impossible Newton told his

friend Haley that the theory of the

motions of the moon made his head eight

and kept him awake so often that he

would think of it no more the problem as

would become clear to Henri Poincare a

two hundred years later was that there

was no simple solution to the three-body

problem blank array had glimpsed what

later became known as chaos chaos really

came into focus in the 1960s when

meteorologist ed Lorenz tried to make a

basic computer simulation of the Earth's

atmosphere

he had 12 equations and 12 variables

things like temperature pressure

humidity and so on and the computer

would print out each time step as a row

of 12 numbers so you could watch how

they evolved over time now the

breakthrough came when Lorenz wanted to

redo a run but as a shortcut he entered

the numbers from halfway through a

previous printout and then he set the

computer calculating he went off to get

some coffee and when he came back and

saw the results Lorenz was stunned the

new run followed the old one for a short

while but then it diverged and pretty

soon it was describing a totally

different state of the atmosphere I mean

totally different weather Lorenz's first

thought of course was that the computer

had broken maybe a vacuum tube had blown

but none had the real reason for the

difference came down to the fact that

printer rounded to three decimal places

whereas the computer calculated with six

so when he entered those initial

conditions the difference of less than

one part in a thousand created totally

different weather just a short time into

the future

now Lorenz tried simplifying his

equations and then simplifying them some

more down to just three equations and

three variables which represented a toy

model of convection essentially a 2d

slice of the atmosphere heated at the

bottom and cooled at the top but again

he got the same type of behavior if he

changed the numbers just a tiny bit the

results diverged dramatically Lorenza

system displayed what's become known as

sensitive dependence on initial

conditions which is the hallmark of

chaos now since Lorenz was working with

three variables we can plot the phase

space of his system in three dimensions

we can pick any point as our initial

state and watch how it evolves does our

point move toward a fixed attractor or a

repeating loop

it doesn't seem to in truth our system

will never revisit the same exact state

again here I actually started with three

closely spaced initial States and

they've been evolving together so far

but now they're starting to diverge from

being arbitrarily close together they

end up on totally different trajectories

this is sensitive dependence on initial

conditions in action now I should point

out that there is nothing random at all

about this system of equations it's

completely deterministic just like the

pendulum so if you could input exactly

the same initial conditions you would

get exactly the same result the problem

is unlike the pendulum this system is

chaotic so any difference in initial

conditions no matter how tiny will be

amplified to a totally different final

state it seems like a paradox but this

system is both deterministic and

unpredictable because in practice you

could never know the initial conditions

with perfect accuracy and I'm talking

infinite decimal places but the result

suggests why even today with huge

supercomputers it's so hard to forecast

the weather more than a week in advance

in fact studies have shown that by the

eighth day of a long-range forecast the

prediction is less accurate than if you

just took the historical average

conditions for that day and knowing

about chaos meteorologists no longer

make just a single forecast instead they

make ensemble forecasts varying initial

conditions and model parameters to

create a set of predictions now far from

being the exception to the rule chaotic

systems have been turning up everywhere

the double pendulum just two simple

pendulums connected together is chaotic

here two double pendulums have been

released simultaneously with almost the

same initial conditions but no matter

how hard you try you could never release

a double pendulum and make it behave the

same way twice its motion will forever

be unpredictable you might think that

chaos always requires a lot of energy or

irregular motions but this system of

five fidgets spinners with repelling

magnets in each of their arms is chaotic

too at first glance the system seems to

repeat regularly but if you watch more

closely you'll notice some strange

motions a spinner suddenly flips the

other way even our solar system is not

predictable a study simulating our solar

system for a hundred million years into

the future found its behavior as a whole

to be chaotic with a characteristic time

of about four million years that means

within say 10 or 15 million years some

planets or moons may have collided or

been flung out of the solar system

entirely the very system we think of as

the model of order is unpredictable on

even modest timescales

so how well can we predict the future

not very well at all at least when it

comes to chaotic systems the further

into the future you try to predict the

harder it becomes and past a certain

point predictions are no better than

guesses the same is true when looking

into the past of chaotic systems and

trying to identify initial causes I

think of it kind of like a fog that sets

in the further we try to look into the

future or into the past

chaos puts fundamental limits on what we

can know about the future of systems and

what we can say about their past but

there is a silver lining let's look

again at the phase space of lorenza's

equations if we start with a whole bunch

of different initial conditions and

watch them evolve initially the motion

is messy but soon all the points have

moved towards or onto an object the

object coincidentally looks a bit like a

butterfly it is the attractor for a

large range of initial conditions the

system evolves into a state on this

attractor now remember all the paths

traced out here never cross and they

never connect to form a loop if they did

then they would continue on that loop

forever and the behavior would be

periodic and predictable so each path

here is actually an infinite curve in a

finite space but how is that possible

fractals but that's a story for another

video

this particular attractor is called the

Lorenz attractor probably the most

famous example of a chaotic attractor

though many others have been found for

other systems of equation

now if people have heard anything about

the butterfly effect it's usually about

how tiny causes make the future

unpredictable but the science behind the

butterfly effect also reveals a deep and

beautiful structure underlying the

dynamics one that can provide useful

insights into the behavior of a system

so you can't predict how any individual

state will evolve but you can say how a

collection of states evolve and at least

in the case of lorenza's equations they

take the shape of a butterfly
