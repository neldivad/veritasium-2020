more about them at the end of the show

on february 15 2013 over chelyabinsk

russia

an asteroid heavier than the eiffel

tower slammed into the atmosphere

and then 30 kilometers above the ground

it exploded

this violent event was brighter than the

sun

but so high up that it was silent

for a full 90 seconds after the blast

which only made the devastation worse so

you see all these videos of people

looking look at what was that they see

the

smoke trail in the sky oh that's amazing

and then

you know just when you think nothing's

gonna happen the shock wave hits

it blows out the windows thousand people

got glass in their face in their eyes

because they're looking through the

windows

the shockwave damaged thousands of

buildings and injured

1500 people

what makes the chelyabinsk incident kind

of embarrassing

is that the very same day scientists had

predicted that an asteroid would make a

close

flyby of earth and they were right

16 hours after chelyabinsk a similar

sized asteroid

known as duende came within 27 000

kilometers of earth's surface

that's closer than satellites in

geosynchronous orbit

but while they correctly predicted this

close approach

they completely missed the unrelated

asteroid that exploded over russia

and the truth is this happens all the

time we're really not that good at

detecting asteroids before they hit us

since 1988 over 1200 asteroids bigger

than a meter have collided with the

earth

and of those we detected only five

before they hit never with more than a

day of warning

with all our technology and all the

telescopes across the earth

not to mention the ones in space why do

we struggle to detect

dangerous asteroids before they strike

what are the chances

that a big asteroid will hit wiping out

most

if not all life on earth and

if we saw one coming what could we do

about it

[Music]

asteroids are the leftover debris from

when our solar system formed

four and a half billion years ago rocks

and dust clumped together into molten

protoplanets

inside heavy elements metals like

iron nickel and iridium sank into the

core

leaving lighter silicate minerals on the

surface

some of these protoplanets grew into the

planets we know today

but many more collided with each other

breaking into pieces

these pieces continued orbiting the sun

and smashing into each other and

breaking into even smaller fragments

these became the asteroids which is why

some of them are rocky loose

conglomerates of

gravel-sized rocks called rubble piles

and others from the cores of

planetesimals

are mostly metal so this

is this is an iron meteorite

and essentially it's the piece of a core

of a small

planetary body like basically a small

planet

that formed four and a half billion

years ago

differentiated so the core material fell

out

and then this thing was smashed apart by

a collision with another asteroid

that's the oldest thing you'll ever see

most of the asteroids have stable orbits

between mars and jupiter

in the main asteroid belt but some

have made their way closer to earth and

these are known as

near-earth objects they are of greatest

interest to

us because of the threat they pose in

his last book

stephen hawking considered an asteroid

impact to be the greatest

threat to life on earth but

finding asteroids is difficult for

several reasons

most are spotted by ground-based

telescopes so what you do is you take

a sequence of pictures one two three one

two three four and you look for

essentially a moving dot and it's moving

because it's orbiting around the sun

whereas the stuff far away the stars and

galaxies are not

but you have to look carefully asteroids

are

not very big they range from meters up

to

kilometers in size and in the vast

expanse of space

rocks like that just don't stand out and

even the small ones can be damaging

the chelyabinsk meteor was only around

20 meters in diameter

roughly the width of two school buses

plus asteroids are rough and dark

they only reflect around 15 of the light

that hits them

so our best chance to see them is when

they're fully illuminated by the sun

and that's why over 85 percent of the

near-earth asteroids we've detected

were found in the 45 degrees of sky

directly

opposite the sun this is called the

opposition effect and

it means there are likely more

near-earth and potentially hazardous

asteroids

that haven't been detected yet any

asteroid

approaching from the direction of the

sun just

can't be seen this is exactly what

happened

with chelyabinsk

so far we have detected and cataloged

a million asteroids the vast majority of

which

are in the main asteroid belt but

24 000 are near earth objects

ones that we need to keep a particularly

close eye on

because even once you've detected an

asteroid it's hard to tell

if it will hit the earth so if you just

discover an object

and you only have data from a few days

then you can't really

tell where it's going to go because

you're trying to take this little

arc of motion and predict it far into

the future so what you need is

observations over years and years

but even if you have perfect

observations of an asteroid

there's kind of a fundamental limit to

how far in the future you can predict

and that's because a couple of effects

but one is that you know

they're not just orbiting the sun with

no other influence

all of the planets have gravity and all

of the planets are pulling

on near-earth asteroids and can change

the orbit

significantly so there is something

called dynamical chaos which basically

means

after a certain amount of time you don't

know where the asteroid is going to be

and in practice what that means is we

can't do any work

more than 100 years in the future so the

maximum time you can predict

with any accuracy at all where a body

will be is about 100 years

and this is pretty important because we

know with

certainty if one does hit the results

will be

dramatic

this is behringer crater in arizona it's

named after mining engineer

daniel behringer who was the first to

suggest

it was formed by a meteorite impact the

prevailing view even up until the 1950s

was that it was created by volcanic

activity

but behringer was convinced it was the

site of an iron meteorite

impact so in 1903 he

staked a mining claim and began drilling

for the metallic

meteorite which he believed to be worth

more than a billion

1903 dollars yeah so people are

motivated by money right so they thought

hey we can get some iron for free

basically so they started to drill

in the bottom of the crater and found

nothing

and then they started to do other

exploratory drills and this went on for

years and

decades they started to drill sideways

somebody said you know maybe it came in

from an angle which it did

and maybe the iron is is not under the

middle but maybe it's

over there under the wall so he was

doing drilling if you go there you can

see the drills now

he was drilling around the wall he found

nothing so what they didn't realize is

when you have

an impact at high speed it's not like

you're throwing a stone

into a brick wall you know and it makes

a hole and sticks in there

or just bounces off it's explosive it's

like totally explosive so the kinetic

energy of the projectile comes in

maybe 30 kilometers per second the

kinetic energy of the projectile is big

enough to completely vaporize the

projectile turns it into a gas

and that gas is super hot and super high

pressure and it explodes and it blows

out the crater

so the projectile doesn't really exist

after the impact i mean little pieces

can survive

but this 50 meter body was basically

obliterated so he was looking for

something that

did not exist he spent 27 years

mining the crater drilling down to a

depth of over 400 meters

but what he was searching for had

vaporized on impact

50 000 years earlier the 50-meter

asteroid

not that much bigger than chelyabinsk

released

the energy equivalent of 10 megatons of

tnt

that's over 600 times the energy of the

hiroshima bomb so

the thing that most closely resembles a

meteorite impact

is a very large nuclear explosion

this is the actual size of the t-rex

skull and i thought

this is such a cool thing i got to have

it so i bought the t-rex

[Applause]

the dinosaurs were wiped out by a 10

kilometer sized

asteroid that hit about 65 million years

ago so

above the critical size which is

probably a couple of kilometers

uh an impactor delivers so much energy

that it has a global effect

[Music]

so essentially it launches a whole bunch

of debris

into sub-orbital trajectories so the

ejector goes around the earth

falls back into the earth all over even

on the other side of the planet from

where the impact occurred

and what that means is the whole sky

lights up with

wall-to-wall meteors

so you can imagine the sky turning from

you know a nice

blue day like today into essentially

a red hot glow like being inside a

toaster oven

[Music]

so the first effect of this impact apart

from the initial blast

near where the actual impact occurred

the first effect is the sky

turns into a great source of heat and it

cooks everything on the ground so these

guys were basically

cooked cooked alive cooked alive as they

were walking around

the only animals that had a chance were

the ones living in tunnels

under the ground or maybe um in the

water

they were able to to come back and take

over without having to deal with the

dinosaurs as a

major obstacle what are our chances that

earth gets hit

by a another 10 kilometer or bigger

asteroid

in your lifetime assuming you live to be

a hundred years old you have a 10

kilometer impactor like the kt

extinction event every 100 million years

or something like that

so the probability of getting it in one

year is one in 100 million so you have

one in a million chance of dying from

a 10 kilometer impact but because we

know that there are no

10 kilometer impactors with a path that

intersects the earth

for the next 100 years your chance of

dying from that is actually zero

so work done already has reduced that

down you know from one in a million to

to nothing

so the good news is there won't be

another dinosaur style extinction event

in our lifetimes

but there are exponentially more

asteroids of smaller sizes

for every 10 kilometer asteroid there

are roughly a thousand

one kilometer asteroids and they're

still capable of doing

a lot of damage one or two kilometers

is capable of causing local but massive

damage so that means

you know instead of wiping out the

entire world

you would wipe out the equivalent of

some

european country like france or germany

to mention

two of my favorites so you would

obliterate those countries

with the impact of a one or two

kilometer sized body

do we know about all the one to two

kilometer

bodies that could hit us we think that

we know 90 something percent maybe 98

of those bodies have been identified

and we have their orbits and we can make

reasonable predictions for the next

10 years or something about where

they'll be

and we seem to be okay at the moment but

you know

uh what about the ones that are just a

little bit less than a

kilometer what about the ones that are

800 meters that's still pretty

pretty savage if it hits and this is

possibly where the greatest threat of

asteroids remains

a few hundred meters is large enough to

obliterate a large city

but small enough that we haven't

detected them all yet

we're missing a lot of hundred meter

sized projectiles

and those guys are big enough to cause

substantial damage on the earth

depending on where they hit

so it could destroy a city yeah it would

knock down the buildings in the city

it would cause city-wide fire and

if it hit the ground it would throw up

ejecta

that would come back down and rain on

the ground would be high-speed ejector

that would obliterate a 100 kilometer

zone

around it and this could happen tomorrow

well it could yeah

[Laughter]

if we saw a big one coming

what's our best bet for i mean could we

do anything about it what would we do

about it

is there anything we can do to actively

no there's nothing we can do

i was on a committee that looked at that

okay like 10 years ago what could we

what could we do one option would be to

try to bomb it

it's a standard thing we don't know how

that would work out

even when you got it there and even if

you could explode it on the surface

or in the surface it's not clear what

you would do because typically what

happens is you

blow up a body and the fragments move

out they expand out but not very quickly

and then gravity pulls them back

together again so it would reform

as a rubble pile if it was not already a

rubble pile to begin with which it

probably would be because of past

impacts

so blowing up a rubble pile is something

that we don't really know about

another idea is you could attach you

could be all gentle and attach

a rocket to the asteroid and just try to

push it aside let's nudge it aside

instead of trying to blow it up let's

just push it gently aside

so that it deflects it and it doesn't

hit the earth the trouble is

when you work out the numbers none of

the rockets that we have can push it

around enough you would have to keep the

rockets

attached to the surface which we don't

know how to do remember it's a rotating

body

for centuries to have a significant

effect on the motion of the asteroid so

forget

bombs forget attaching rockets

ablating the surface basically you boil

the surface with a laser

we don't have any lasers powerful enough

and probably can't make lasers powerful

enough to do that from the earth we

would have to take the lasers to the

object which is even more difficult

the idea that you could wrap an asteroid

in cooking foil aluminum cooking foil is

another nice one that may be a good one

the best one

but it still doesn't really work because

we don't know how to do that

we don't have a way to launch enough

cooking foil

to wrap up an asteroid and change its

radiative properties which would itself

move the asteroid around so the truth is

to be honest we do not

have a way now to deflect

a kilometer-sized asteroid at all

that could destroy a country yeah we

just don't have a way

10 kilometers 10 kilometers is

absolutely a thousand times more

hopeless

so when when we discussed this you know

we we had all these grand ideas oh we

could do this and this and none of them

worked we came down to the most basic

idea well

maybe if we could figure out where the

asteroid is going to hit like which city

is it going to

explode over we can evacuate that city

and then we looked at the history of

city evacuations and we looked at cases

you know where

for example you have like a week's

warning where some

hurricane system is going to come in and

flood a city

and an evacuation uh just doesn't work

either

and the reason is very very simple like

going into a city there are not that

many

freeways if you have millions of people

trying to get on a freeway

the first time a car breaks down you you

block that freeway

so instantly you have millions of people

trying to get out of the target zone

and and they won't be able to because

all of the roads will be

instantly blocked so again even that

even evacuation of a city is probably

the most

hopeful thing that we could try to do

even that's really really difficult

because of the large numbers of people

involved

what i think all reasonable people would

conclude is

let's do the thing that we can do first

so let's look for them

let's do the surveys let's build the

telescopes let's put this telescope in

space that will be

a major contribution to understanding

the threat from the asteroids

and then when we find a particular

object

that looks especially dangerous then we

can focus on it

we can focus everything we have on it

and we can begin to think seriously and

with real motivation

about ways to deflect it

now if you're concerned about the world

ending in an asteroid impact

let me set your mind at ease there are

many

other potential global catastrophes

summarized in this

map of doom made by my friend dom over

at domain of science

so if you want to see which of these

horrible scenarios is likeliest to be

our downfall

well go check out the video on his

channel

my oldest now knows how to do the

sponsor message

do you want to say it this episode is

sponsored by kiwico

very good kiwi co creates awesome

projects and toys

to get kids making they offer eight

subscription lines for kids of

all ages all the way down to newborns

and with the holidays right around the

corner kiwi co is the perfect gift idea

as a parent i know that lots of gifts

get unwrapped and played with for a

little while

but then kids lose interest but a kiwi

co-crate subscription will keep kids

engaged

learning and making throughout the year

now i use their crates with my sons

and they are a lot of fun while also

being educational

and i want my kids to see learning as a

form of play and kiwico really helps me

do that

plus all the supplies you need come

right in the box so you never need

to run out to the store now here i built

a

perpetual calendar a reminder that each

passing day

brings the chance of an asteroid impact

for viewers of this video kiwico is

offering 50 off your first

month of any crate just go to kiwico.com

veritasium50 and i'll put that link down

in the description

so i want to thank kiwiko for sponsoring
