this video is about a pattern people

thought was impossible

and a material that wasn't supposed to

exist

the story begins over 400 years ago

in prague i'm now in prague and the

czech republic which is perhaps my

favorite european city that i've visited

so far

i'm going to visit the kepler museum

because he's one of the most famous

scientists who lived and worked around

prague

i want to tell you five things about

johannes kepler

that are essential to our story

number one kepler is most famous for

figuring out that the shapes of

planetary orbits are

ellipses but before he came to this

realization

he invented a model of the solar system

in which the planets were on nested

spheres

separated by the platonic solids

what are the platonic solids well they

are objects where

all of the faces are identical and all

of the vertices

are identical which means you can rotate

them through some

angle and they look the same as they did

before

so the cube is an obvious example then

you also have

the tetrahedron the octahedron

the dodecahedron which has 12 pentagonal

sides

and the icosahedron which has 20 sides

and that's it there are just five

platonic solids

which was convenient for kepler because

in his day they only knew

about six planets so this allowed him to

put a unique platonic solid between

each of the planetary spheres

essentially he used them as spacers

he carefully selected the order of the

platonic solids

so that the distances between planets

would match astronomical observations as

closely as possible

he had this deep abiding belief that

there was some geometric regularity in

the universe

and of course there is just not this

two kepler's attraction to geometry

extended to more practical questions

like

how do you stack cannonballs so they

take up the least space on a ship's deck

by 1611 kepler had an answer hexagonal

close packing

and the face centered cubic arrangement

are both equivalently

and optimally efficient with cannonballs

occupying about 74 percent of the volume

they take up

now this might seem like the obvious way

to stack spheres i mean it is the way

that oranges

are stacked in the supermarket but

kepler hadn't proved it he just

stated it as fact which is why this

became known as kepler's conjecture

now it turns out he was right but it

took around

400 years to prove it the formal proof

was only published in the journal form

of mathematics

in 2017. three

kepler published his conjecture in a

pamphlet called deniva sexangula

on the six cornered snowflake in which

he wondered

there must be a definite cause why

whenever snow begins to fall

its initial formations invariably

display the shape of a six cornered

starlet

for if it happens by chance why do they

not fall just as well with five corners

or with seven

why always with six in kepler's day

there was no real theory of atoms or

molecules or how they self-arrange into

crystals

but kepler seemed to be on the verge of

understanding this

i mean he speculates about the smallest

natural unit of a liquid like water

essentially a water molecule and how

these tiny units could

stack together mechanically to form the

hexagonal crystal

not unlike the hexagonal close-packed

cannonballs

four kepler knew that regular hexagons

can cover a flat surface perfectly with

no gaps in mathematical jargon we say

the hexagon tiles the plane

periodically you know that a tiling is

periodic

if you can duplicate a portion of it and

continue the pattern only through

translation

with no rotations or reflections

periodic tilings can also have

rotational symmetry

a rhombus pattern has twofold symmetry

because if you rotate it 180 degrees one

half turn

the pattern looks the same as it did

before equilateral triangles have

three-fold symmetry

squares have four-fold symmetry and

hexagons have six-fold symmetry but

those

are the only symmetries you can have two

three four and six there is

no fivefold symmetry regular pentagons

do not tile the plane but that didn't

stop kepler from trying

see this pattern right here he published

it in his book harmonics mundi or

harmony of the world it has a certain

five-fold symmetry

but not exactly and it's not entirely

clear

how you would continue this pattern to

tile the whole plane

there are an infinite number of shapes

that can tile the plane periodically

the regular hexagon can only tile the

plane periodically

there are also an infinite number of

shapes that can tile the plane

periodically

or non-periodically for example

isosceles triangles can tile the plane

periodically

but if you rotate a pair of triangles

well then the pattern is no longer

perfectly periodic

a sphinx tile can join with another

rotate it at 180 degrees

and tile the plane periodically but a

different arrangement of these

same tiles is non-periodic

this raises the question are there some

tiles that can

only tile the plane non-periodically

well in 1961 how wang was studying

multi-colored square tiles the rules

were

touching edges must be the same color

and you can't rotate or reflect tiles

only slide them around now the question

was

if you're given a set of these tiles can

you tell

if they will tile the plane wang's

conjecture

was that if they can tile the plane well

they can do so periodically

but it turned out wang's conjecture was

false

his student robert berger found a set of

20

426 tiles that could tile the plane

but only non-periodically

think about that for a second here we

have a finite set of tiles okay it's a

large number

but it's finite and it can tile all the

way out to infinity

without ever repeating the same pattern

there's no way even to force them to

tile periodically

and a set of tiles like this that can

only tile the plane

non-periodically is called an aperiodic

tiling

and mathematicians wanted to know were

there aperiodic tilings that required

fewer tiles well robert berger himself

found a set with only 104 donald knuth

got the number down to 92

and then in 1969 you had raphael

robinson who came up with

six tiles just six that could tile the

entire plane without ever repeating

then along came roger penrose who would

ultimately get the number down to two

penrose started with a pentagon he added

other pentagons around it

and of course noticed the gaps but this

new shape

could fit within a larger pentagon which

gave penrose an idea what if he took the

original pentagons

and broke them into smaller pentagons

well now some of the gaps start

connecting up into

rhombus shapes other gaps have three

spikes

but penrose didn't stop there he

subdivided the pentagons again

now some of the gaps are large enough

that you can use pentagons to fill in

part of them

and the remaining holes you're left with

are just rhombuses

stars and a fraction of a star that

penrose calls a justice cap

you can keep subdividing indefinitely

and you will only ever find

these shapes so with just these pieces

you can tile the plane

aperiodically with an almost five-fold

symmetry

the fifth thing about johannes kepler is

that if you take his pentagon pattern

and you overlay it on top of penrose's

the two match up perfectly

[Music]

once penrose had his pattern he found

ways to simplify the tiles

he distilled the geometry down to just

two tiles a thick rhombus

and a thin rhombus the rules for how

they can come together can be enforced

by bumps and notches

or by matching colors and the rules

ensure that these

two single tiles can only tile the plane

non-periodically

just two tiles go all the way out to

infinity without

ever repeating now one way to see this

is to print up two copies of the same

penrose pattern

and one on a transparency and overlay

them on top of each other

now the resulting interference you get

is called a moire

pattern where it is dark the patterns

are

not aligned you can see there are

also some light spots and that's where

the patterns do

match up and as i rotate around you can

see the

light spots move in and get smaller and

then at a certain point

they move out and get bigger

and what i want to do is try to enlarge

one of these bright spots

and see how big of a matching section i

can find

oh yes yes it's like

all of a sudden everything is

illuminated i love it

so these patterns are perfectly matching

up here here here here and here but

not along these radial lines

and that is why they look dark so what

this shows us

is that you can't ever match any section

perfectly to one

beneath it there will always be some

difference

so my favorite penrose pattern is

actually made out of

these two shapes which are called kites

and darts and they have these very

particular angles

and the way they're meant to match up is

based on these two curves you can see

there's a curve on each piece

and so you have to connect them so that

the curves are continuous

and that's the rule that allows you to

build an aperiodic tiling from these two

pieces

so uh i laser cut thousands

of these pieces and oh i'm gonna

try to put them together and make a huge

penrose oh man

come on

if you stare at a pattern of kites and

darts you'll start to notice all kinds

of

regularities like stars and suns

but look closer and they don't quite

repeat in the way you'd expect them to

these two tiles create an ever-changing

pattern that extends out to infinity

without repeating does this mean

there is only one pattern of kites and

darts

and every picture that we see is just a

portion

of that overall singular pattern

well the answer is no there are actually

an uncountably infinite number of

different patterns of kites and darts

that tile the entire plane

and it gets weirder if you were on any

of those tilings

you wouldn't be able to tell which one

it is

i mean you might try to look further and

further out gather more and more data

but

it's futile because any finite region

of one of these tilings appears

infinitely many times

in all of the other versions of those

tilings

i mean don't get me wrong those tilings

are also different in

an infinite number of ways but it's

impossible to tell that unless you could

see the whole pattern

which is impossible

there's this kind of paradox to penrose

tilings

where there's an uncountable infinity

of different versions but just by

looking at them

you could never tell them apart

now what if we count up all the kites

and darts in this pattern

well i get 440 kites and 272

darts does that ratio ring any bells

well if you divide one by the other you

get 1.618

that is the golden ratio

so why does the golden ratio appear in

this pattern

well as you know it contains a kind of

five-fold symmetry

and of all the irrational constants the

golden ratio

phi is the most five-ish of the

constants i mean you can express the

golden ratio as

0.5 plus 5 to the power of 0.5

times 0.5 the golden ratio is also

heavily associated with pentagons

i mean the ratio of the diagonal to an

edge

is the golden ratio and the kite and

dart pieces themselves

are actually sections of pentagons same

with the rhombuses

so they actually have the golden ratio

built right

into their construction the fact that

the ratio of kites to darts approaches

the golden ratio an irrational number

provides evidence that the pattern can't

possibly be periodic

if the pattern were periodic then the

ratio of kites to darts

could be expressed as a ratio of two

whole numbers

the number of kites to darts in each

periodic segment

and it goes deeper if you draw on the

tiles

not curves but these particular straight

lines

well now when you put the pattern

together you see something interesting

they all connect up perfectly into

straight lines

there are five sets of parallel lines

this is a kind of proof of the five-fold

symmetry of the pattern

but it is not perfectly regular

take a look at any one set of parallel

lines you'll notice

there are two different spacings call

them long and short

from the bottom we have long short long

short long

long wait that breaks the pattern

these gaps don't follow a periodic

pattern either

but count up the number of longs and

shorts in any section

here i get 13 shorts and 21 longs

and you have the fibonacci sequence

1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21

34 and so on and the ratio of

one fibonacci number to the previous one

approaches

the golden ratio

now the question penrose faced from

other scientists was

could there be a physical analog for

these patterns

do they occur in nature perhaps in

crystal structure

penrose thought that was unlikely the

very nature of a crystal is that it is

made up of repeating units

just as the fundamental symmetries of

the shapes that tile the plane had been

worked out much

earlier the basic unit cells that

compose

all crystals were well established there

are 14 of them

and no one had ever seen a crystal that

failed to fit

one of these patterns and there was

another problem

crystals are built by putting atoms and

molecules together

locally whereas penrose tilings well

they seem to require some sort of

long range coordination take this

pattern for example

you could put a dart over here

and continue to tile out to infinity no

problems

or you could put a kite

over here on the other side again no

problems

but if you place the kite

and dart in here simultaneously

well then this pattern will not work

i mean you can keep tiling for a while

but when you get to somewhere around

here

well it's not gonna work you can put a

dart in there which completes the

pattern nicely but then you get this

really awkward shape there which is

actually the shape of another dart

but if you put that one in there then

the

lines don't match up the pattern doesn't

work so how could this work as a crystal

i mean both of these tiles obey the

local rules

but in the long term they just don't

work in the early 1980s

paul steinhardt and his students were

using computers to model how atoms come

together into condensed matter

that is essentially solid material at

the smallest scales

and he found that locally they like to

form icosahedrons

but this was known to be the most

forbidden shape because it is full

of five-fold symmetries so the question

they posed was

how big can these zykosahedrons get they

thought maybe 10 atoms or

100 atoms but inspired by penrose

tilings

they designed a new kind of structure a

3d analog of penrose tilings now known

as a quasi-crystal

and they simulated how x-rays would

diffract off such a structure

and they found a pattern with rings of

10 points reflecting the five-fold

symmetry

just a few hundred kilometers away

completely unaware of their work another

scientist dan

schechtman created this flaky material

from

aluminum and manganese and when he

scattered electrons off his material

this is the picture he got it

almost perfectly matches the one made by

steinhardt

so if penrose tilings require long

range coordination then how do you

possibly make

quasi crystals well i was talking to

paul steinhardt about this and he told

me

if you just use the matching rules on

the edges

those rules are not strong enough and if

you apply them locally you run into

problems like this you misplace

tiles but he said if you have rules for

the vertices the way the vertices can

connect with each other those rules are

strong enough

locally so that you never make a mistake

and the pattern

can go on to infinity one of the seminal

papers on quasi crystals

was called deniva quinquangula

on the pentagonal snowflake in a shout

out

to kepler now not everyone was delighted

at the announcement of quasi crystals a

material that up until then people

thought

totally defied the laws of nature double

nobel prize winner

linus pauling famously remarked there

are no quasi crystals

only quasi scientists

but uh schechtman got the last laugh he

was awarded the nobel prize for

chemistry in 2011

and quasi crystals have since been grown

with beautiful dodecahedral shapes

they are currently being explored for

applications from

non-stick electrical insulation and

cookware to

ultra durable steel and the thing about

this whole story that fascinates me the

most

is what exists that we just can't

perceive because it's considered

impossible

i mean the symmetries of regular

geometric shapes seemed

so obvious and certain that no one

thought to look beyond them

that is until penrose and what we found

are

patterns that are both beautiful and

counter-intuitive

and materials that existed all along

that we just couldn't see

for what they really are
