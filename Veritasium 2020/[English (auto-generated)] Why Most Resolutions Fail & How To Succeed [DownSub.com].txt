most New Year's resolutions fail so in

this video I want to talk about the

science of why they fail and how to

avoid that so your New Year's

resolutions actually succeed and I want

to tell you about three of my New Year's

resolutions for 2020 the first one is to

stop going to news websites I find I

kill a ton of time by doing that now

don't get me wrong I do think it's

important to know what's going on in the

world but I just don't think following

the day-to-day developments of the news

cycle is the way to do that so instead I

am going to get one newspaper delivered

to my house every week and that is how I

am gonna stay informed

research has shown it is more effective

to make resolutions at new years than at

any other time of the year in fact one

study found that people who made

resolutions on January 1st were 10 times

as likely to stick with them 6 months

later than people who made their

resolutions at other times of the year

in January 1st 2020 is the first day of

a new decade so it may be even better

side note and those of you who want to

argue that the first day of the decade

is actually January 1st 2021 while you

may technically be correct because there

was no year 0 we went straight from 1 BC

to 180 for all intents and purposes

psychologically this January 1st is the

first day of the 2020s and that is what

matters

so the technicalities I think are

unimportant in this argument should be

put to bed the 2020s start on Jan 1 but

now the bad news even a resolution made

at New Year's will most likely fail

which is why gyms are packed in January

but they start to clear out by March

what research has found that only around

8% of people can stick with their

resolutions through the end of the year

so why is this and how do we avoid that

trap I think it all starts with a

misconception

Oh No

Oh No boo get well this is gonna be the

part of the video where I ran on the

treadmill with the treadmills just

broken so I think the misconception is

that people think that in order to make

big changes in their lives that they

have to make some sort of really big

effort I mean let's say your goal was to

run a marathon you might plan on running

ten kilometers

three times a week that seems kind of

proportionate to the end goal and you

might be excited and really motivated to

do it for the first few weeks but at

some point that motivation is gonna lag

and running 10k is gonna seem too hard

and so you're gonna sort of fall back

into old habits the misconception is

thinking you need to go big and so being

over ambitious with your goals and then

not being able to commit and stick to

them I'm gonna fix this the truth is

you're much better off if you pick small

targets that you can hit consistently

that's the idea behind James clears book

atomic habits which is this idea that if

you can get just 1% better every day at

something it will take a minimum amount

of effort but over time the effects will

compound just like compound interest and

James Clare proposes the two-minute rule

pick something that you can do in just

two minutes so if you want to run a

marathon start by say running two

minutes a day that is something that you

can't say you don't have time for and

once that habit sticks well then you can

try to extend it into something more

ambitious the next problem with

resolutions is they are too often vague

the most common resolutions that people

make are to lose weight exercise more

and to eat better the problem is those

things are so nondescript that it's hard

to know if you're making progress and

it's really easy to regress into your

old habits so the science around this

says you need to be specific and write

down your goals people who write down

their goals are 40% more likely to

achieve them that is pretty significant

just by taking that step of

putting pen to paper and I'm thinking

here in this video you should put your

New Year's resolutions in the comments

because at least that is taking a step

towards committing yourself to a goal

for the year my second new year's

resolution for 2020 is to write in a

daily planner every day of this year in

fact I can be more specific than that

I will write one word in this book each

day now I know one word might seem

unhelpfully ridiculously little to write

in this book but I want to commit to

this idea of starting small with the

idea that if I get in the habit of

making the time to at least write down

one word on each one of these pages well

then maybe some days I will write more

than one word and that will be helpful

in terms of planning my day a little bit

and so hopefully I will be more

productive than I would have been

otherwise and then it's really important

to track your progress in an obvious and

visual way and I'm going to use the

everyday calendar by Simone yet oddly

satisfying where there's a button for

every day of the year and you can push

it and the light turns on and that is

really satisfying so I think this will

encourage me to write down a word early

in the day so that I can go and turn on

the light for that day what's great

about this is it's a very visual way to

track my progress and to have it in an

obvious place where I can look at it all

the time and I'll put it in the back of

shot for some of my videos in 2020 so

you guys can see how I'm progressing

towards this goal so the third major

problem with New Year's resolutions is

that people seem to think it's about

having more willpower or motivation

being able to resist temptation better

but willpower is a finite resource and

it can be depleted that there are gonna

be some bad days and that is when you're

gonna relapse so relying on willpower is

not an effective strategy and research

has shown that people who have better

self-control actually just have to

exercise it less the way they're able to

do that is by structuring their

environments so they don't have to

exercise their willpower I find in my

kitchen it's always like the treats and

snacks which are left out on the counter

but the veggies which are like tucked

away in the vegetable crisper drawer and

I get it because you know that's where

the veggies are meant to go to keep them

crisp but the problem is if I don't see

them if they're not in my line of sight

I will just end up eating what's on the

counter and not going digging for

veggies so we need a way of changing our

environments so that we make better

choices which brings me to my third and

final new year's resolution for 2020 I

am deleting social media apps off of my

phone I'm getting rid of Instagram and

Twitter you are watching the exact

moment that I do that

the reason for this is I find I just

kill way too much time going into these

apps and research shows that any tiny

distraction that you have during your

day takes you you know something like

20-25 minutes to get back into your work

and so I'm losing a lot of time to just

procrastinating with these apps so I'm

getting rid of them off my phone so I

don't have to use my willpower to not

click them mindlessly as I normally

would and I've actually downloaded an

app that will block news sites and block

my social media while I'm working

because that way I don't have to

restrain myself the systems that I put

in place will restrain me for me I know

a lot of this sounds a little bit CGP

grey but I think he's onto something you

don't need to follow the day-to-day

movements of the news cycle and you do

not need to be scrolling social media

all the time particularly when you're

trying to get useful work done so that's

how I feel

I want to optimize my 2020 by locking

down all my potential distractions not

needing any willpower and I've got some

small specific and written down targeted

with tracking plans for 2020 so I'd love

to know what

you're planning for 2020 for your New

Year's resolutions what are your plans

for the next decade
