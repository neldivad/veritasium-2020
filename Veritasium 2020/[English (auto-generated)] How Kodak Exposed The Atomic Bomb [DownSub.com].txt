[Music]

there's a place in the new mexico desert

open to the public for just two days out

of the year

but i got to visit by myself with only a

small film crew

this is the trinity bomb test site

where on july 16th 1945 at exactly 5

29 and 45 seconds in the morning the

first

nuclear bomb was exploded

the test was called trinity there was

actually a tower here that stood

100 feet or about 30 meters

[Music]

the list of people who witnessed the

test reads like a who's who of 20th

century physics

fermi feynman oppenheimer von neumann

but the test was top secret the general

public weren't to know

but how do you hide a huge nuclear

explosion

well the albuquerque tribune published a

statement claiming it was a large but

accidental conventional explosion it

wasn't just the general public who were

kept in the dark

the governor of new mexico was not even

aware that trinity was a nuclear test

until

after the bombing of hiroshima even then

details about the blast were scarce

but kodak the film company based on the

other side of the country in new york

state

well they figured out what was happening

it all started with some defective x-ray

film

kodak found when they developed unused

film it showed tens or even

a hundred little dark spots the film had

been exposed to radiation even though it

had never been taken out of its

packaging

this was actually not a new problem

during world war

ii radium was used extensively to make

glow-in-the-dark dials flight

instruments and

watches radium glows because it is

radioactive it gives off alpha particles

now some of this radium ended up on

paper and cardboard at these factories

and because supplies were scarce

leftover paper products were

salvaged and recycled leading small

amounts of radium to

end up in the general paper supply and

when this paper was used to package up

kodak film

radiation from radium would expose the

film before it was ever used

and it was such a problem that kodak

altered their supply chain carefully

selecting

just a few paper mills where they could

strictly control the raw materials

one of the mills was in vincennes

indiana on the wabash river

it made strawboard which was inserted

between sheets of x-ray film

now for months this strawboard was

working perfectly until a batch

manufactured on august 6 1945 started to

cause spots to appear on the x-ray film

so julian webb a scientist at kodak was

tasked with solving the problem

so he punched out little holes of

strawboard behind where the film had

been exposed

and then he measured the alpha particles

coming off that material

but the level was not appreciably higher

than background

and this ruled out radium and the other

naturally occurring isotopes of uranium

thorium and actinium

all alpha emitters but when he measured

beta radiation

he found significant activity this

matched what he saw on the film

the radiation penetrated several layers

something beta particles can do

but not alpha and over a period of

months

he measured the half-life of the

radioactive substance finding it was

only about 30 days

this half-life combined with the energy

of the beta particles led webb to

conclude that the radioactive

contaminant was most likely

cerium 141 an isotope that could

only have come from a nuclear fission

explosion

what's more the same contaminant

appeared in paper from another of

kodak's mills

this one hundreds of kilometers away in

tama iowa

so how did cerium 141 end up in that

straw board

well when that first atomic bomb

exploded in the new mexico desert

the plutonium core underwent a fission

chain reaction

plutonium nuclei ripped in two releasing

energy and more neutrons to continue the

chain reaction

but vision is a messy process it doesn't

always split the nucleus into the same

products

instead hundreds of different nuclei are

produced

virtually all of them radioactive and

they are carried up into the

stratosphere with the mushroom cloud

and dispersed on air currents whichever

way the wind blows

in this case they traveled over a

thousand kilometers ending up over

iowa and indiana here rain captured some

of these radioactive particles causing

them to fall

out of the sky hence the term

radioactive fallout

this radioactive material ended up in

rivers like the ones that run beside the

two kodak paper mills

which used that river water to make

their paper so that's how cerium 141

ended up fogging kodak's x-ray film

and exposing the u.s nuclear secret now

word of kodak's detection made it back

to scientists at los alamos

who were intrigued and wanted to know

more a consultant wrote to webb to find

out how much radioactivity per square

mile he detected

and the size of the particles which fell

and the half-life of the activity

although webb completed his experiments

by the end of 1945

he only published them in physical

review in 1949

and that's because i'm sure he

recognized just how sensitive his

findings were

after all he himself had worked on the

manhattan project at berkeley

and oak ridge using electromagnetic

techniques to separate uranium isotopes

what was clear to kodak was that they

needed to take steps to protect their

film

and so they installed air samplers to

monitor for fallout in the air intakes

of their buildings

fallout is a vitally important subject

bombs are being tested which to some

extent

contaminate the atmosphere now the us

government was aware they needed to

carefully consider where to test nuclear

bombs

what we need is a site closer to our

stateside laboratories and available air

support

somewhere in the continental united

states but where

after trinity the manhattan project's

chief of radiological safety stafford

warren

recommended tests be conducted at least

150 miles

from civilian populations in 1948 an air

force meteorologist colonel holzman

told the site selection committee that a

location on the east coast would be best

because otherwise the prevailing

westerly winds across the u.s would

spread the fallout across the country

the site they chose was nevada almost as

far west as you can go and just 100

miles from las vegas

the rationale was this site was closer

to weapons labs so it would accelerate

their development

after the first bomb test there in 1951

kodak detected fallout at their

headquarters in rochester new york

after a snowstorm geiger counters read

25 times the normal background

so kodak threatened to sue the us

government for the

considerable amount of damage to our

products resulting from the nevada tests

or from any further

atomic energy tests but instead of a

lawsuit

the two sides came to an agreement the

atomic energy commission would give

kodak

and indeed the entire photographic

industry advanced warning about upcoming

tests and where the fallout was likely

to end up given

meteorological models in return the

company agreed to keep quiet about

radioactive fallout

and from 1951 until 1963 the u.s

conducted a hundred

above-ground nuclear tests in nevada the

resulting mixture of radioactive nuclei

was blown

as predicted across most of the country

when these atoms fell on agricultural

land they were eaten by livestock or

taken up in crops and they became part

of the food supply

radioactive iodine 131 eaten by cows is

passed on to humans through their milk

and this is particularly problematic

because iodine is concentrated by the

body in the thyroid gland

and children with small developing

thyroids

drink the most milk it's estimated that

the nuclear tests led to tens of

thousands of extra cases

of thyroid cancer the atomic energy

commission wasn't too worried about

iodine 131

because it has a radioactive half-life

of only eight days it decays quickly

they were more concerned about

strontium-90 which has a half-life of

almost 30 years

strontium-90 because of a unique

combination of properties

probably represents the greatest danger

strontium-90 behaves biochemically like

calcium

so when ingested it ends up in our teeth

and bones

and as it emits ionizing beta radiation

it can cause bone cancer

cancer in the surrounding tissues or

leukemia

in what's become known as the baby tooth

survey scientists in st

louis collected up 320 000 teeth between

1950 and 1970.

they found that kids born in 1963 had 50

times more strontium in their baby teeth

than those born in 1950.

presently existing evidence indicates

that fallout

has caused only a small increase in

background radiation

and correspondingly only a minute

increase

in mutations in reality both iodine 131

and strontium 90 plus

other radioactive isotopes in the

fallout almost certainly

increased rates of cancer and other

diseases in the u.s population

this is borne out by studies showing

correlations between rates of disease

and

radioactive isotope uptake the graph

shows a peak in 1964 just after the

partial nuclear

test ban treaty was signed in 1963 it

banned nuclear tests in the atmosphere

underwater and in outer space leaving

only underground tests

a central aim of the treaty was to

address growing public concern

over the scale of nuclear tests and the

resulting radioactive fallout

when the u.s senate finally held a

hearing on the matter almost 50 years

later in 1997

the agreement with kodak was sharply

criticized especially by

senator tom harkin who said the

government warned the entire

photographic industry and provided maps

and forecasts of potential contamination

where i asked were the maps for dairy

farmers where were the warnings to

parents of children in these areas

the government protected rolls of film

but not the lives of our kids

there's something wrong with this

picture and i think the main problem was

that in the 40s and 50s

not enough was known about the

biological effects of radioactive

fallout

every so often a gene changes or mutates

and a characteristic of the organism is

altered

we do not know the exact process by

which mutations occur

cancers took years or even decades to

appear

and fallout models predicted a more

uniform and therefore less concentrated

spread

of contaminants when students in albany

new york measured a thousand times

background levels after a heavy

rainstorm

well the atomic energy commission's

report about the event called it

an interesting example of a small area

of very intense fallout

now concerned with alarming people

unnecessarily in downwind communities

the atomic energy commission's approach

was to

limit as much as possible the

information that was shared

their conclusion it seems was that

people are less sensitive to radiation

than film is so the studies of

radioactive fallout remain

inconclusive what is certain is that

1945 marked the start of a new

era no radioactive fallout before then

and lots after it

and scientists have shown you can use

this to detect wine forgeries

any wine made in the last 75 years will

give off distinctive gamma rays from

cesium-137

whereas none before that date will plus

the level of activity can be used to

estimate the vintage at least between

1952 and

1980 a similar technique can be used to

detect art forgeries because

old paint contains no radioactive cesium

or strontium

you can even use strontium 90 to

determine the age of a skeleton

how long ago that person died given it's

in the past 75 years or so

this technique has been employed in

dozens of forensic cases

where there previously was no reliable

method of estimating the year of death

if it was within the last 50 years

this method works because while we're

alive we are ingesting strontium-90

something that stops when we die to this

day

we all have some strontium-90 in our

bones albeit at lower levels

it's been about two half-lives since the

peak of radioactive contamination so

three quarters of it have decayed

and the rest has dispersed throughout

the environment so

these days it's no longer much of a

health concern

still it is there inside every one of us

a signal that can't be covered up or

faked we are of this modern age

in your bones are the literal atomic

fragments of atomic bombs that

exploded decades ago
