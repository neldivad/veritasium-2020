[Music]

this is me at the end of college

so anyway so today i'm packing up my

room is absolutely disgusting

uh there's dust all over the place

unbelievable how much dust this place

accumulates

just unreal 21 year old me was

apparently fascinated by dust

but where does it all come from well in

this video

we are going to get to the bottom of

this now this video was sponsored by

google

and when they approached me about

sponsoring a video i suggested i show

you

how i use google to research a complex

question

after all research is just research

anyway i couldn't pick a simple question

like how far away is the moon

how old is derek muller or how much wood

could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck

could chuck wood

because the video would be over already

but in the space of all possible queries

questions like these with clear

unambiguous answers are by far in the

minority

in fact of all the billions of search

queries typed into google every day

fully 15 are ones that google

has never even seen before so google

never actually gives you answers instead

in just a fraction of a second it uses

algorithms to select the most relevant

information from the hundreds of

billions of web pages it has indexed

what you do with that information is up

to you

so for this video i intentionally

selected something surrounded by

myths dust unbelievable

so a while back when i was filming a

different video a

phd scientist told me you know 70 of

household dust is dead skin

and i'd heard that before and chances

are you have two

if you type is dust into google the top

autocomplete result is

dead skin because that's one of the most

common ways people complete that query

but a quick scan of this page suggests

that the claim

is not true it's a misconception from

live science

sometimes a specific percentage of dust

is said to be dead skin

usually about 70 or 80 percent but

unless you're a molten bird or

reptile or you work in dr frankenstein's

laboratory

very little of your environment is

composed of dead body parts

or bbc science magazine which asks what

is dust made of

think it's human skin think again the

article says

it's a misconception that it's mostly

from outside the rest is

carpet fluff and clothes fibers and sure

enough all over the web you'll find

people debunking this idea

so is that it case closed hardly

i mean i'm not just gonna do one search

and call it a day

it's important to be aware of your own

biases

when i started this search the claim

seemed false

the idea that 70 to 80 of dust is dead

skin

it's exactly the sort of thing that is

gross enough to spread as an urban

legend

but it just seems implausible i mean if

most dust is dead skin

then why do abandoned buildings get

dusty over time

the debunking claims fit my

preconceptions so it would be easy to

stop here

but you got to be careful not just to

search to confirm what you already

thought

a common mistake people make is putting

the answer they are looking for

right in the search query looking more

closely

these websites lack scientific papers as

references

and i'm curious if the idea that 70 to

80 of dust

is dead skin if that's totally wrong

then how did the myth get started in the

first place

surely some dust must be dead skin but

how much

well a good strategy is to start broad

how do you define

dust exactly well dust is generally

defined as

particles that can become airborne for a

significant period of time

when perturbed by natural forces but how

long

is a significant period of time and what

are

natural forces exactly so the definition

of dust has

fuzzy boundaries kind of like dust

itself

if you ask the question how big is a

dust particle you get different answers

the international standardization

organization defines dust as any

particle smaller than 75 micrometers in

diameter

that's roughly the width of a human hair

the glossary of atmospheric chemistry

terms includes anything up to

100 micrometers but i've found several

papers that

include particles as large as two

millimeters

this large discrepancy is due to the

fact the most important property of a

dust particle

is not its size but its settling

velocity

which then determines how long it can

stay airborne

a 100 micrometer metal ball would fall

to the ground very quickly while a two

millimeter long cotton fiber could float

on

indoor air currents indefinitely so to

get around the different sizes

shapes and densities of dust particles

the international standardization

organization

has a way of calculating an effective

diameter

they define it as the diameter of a

hypothetical sphere of density one gram

per centimeter cubed

having the same terminal settling

velocity in calm

air as the particle in question

regardless of its geometric size

shape and true density

by any of these metrics a single human

skin cell with an average diameter of

around 30 micrometers

would count as dust so then how many

dead skin cells

are we shedding you'd think the average

rate of skin shedding would be well

established

but the internet is a tangled web of

misquotations and missing citations when

it comes to skin

in trying to answer this question i

found dozens of web articles saying we

shed anywhere between

30 000 skin cells per day to 300 000

skin cells per minute

and estimated weights of dead skin as

high as nine pounds a year

per person using google scholar a great

resource for searching published

scientific research

i was able to track down several

peer-reviewed sources that agreed on the

numbers

every hour you create about 20 million

new skin cells

as those new skin cells form they push

older cells

up through the layers of the epidermis

and over a period of weeks they flatten

out

and harden forming the barrier that

protects our bodies from the outside

world

ultimately these dead skin cells fall

off usually

one by one for healthy skin so we

are constantly molting like a snake we

just don't notice it because our skin

comes off one cell at a time

fun fact dead skin cells are shed more

rapidly from your forearms than from

your back

and more rapidly from your back than

from your abdomen and one of the ways

scientists have measured

these rates of skin shedding is actually

by taping containers

onto people's skin

and collecting up the dead skin cells

shed over at least a 48 hour period

yeah i'm gonna regret this based on

these measurements we know that each

square

centimeter of your body is shedding

around a thousand dead skin cells per

hour

now the average adult body has a surface

area of nearly two

square meters meaning you are shedding

nearly 20

million dead skin cells per hour that

adds up to

half a billion dead skin cells per day

now half a billion dead skin cells

weigh between one and two grams that's

just

a little bit less than the weight of a

penny

over a year that means you shed half a

kilogram or over

a pound of dead skin if you want to

think about it another

way in a single year you give off around

180 billion

dead skin cells that's roughly the same

number

as there are stars in our milky way

galaxy

an average family of 2.6 people could

cover the entire horizontal surface of

an average 2 000 square foot home

with a layer of skin cells one cell deep

in around

200 days that is assuming all their dead

skin cells accumulate around the house

which of course is not true some will

come off in the shower and some will get

captured in clothes and bed sheets and

be

rinsed out in the wash not to mention

dead skin cells shed outside the home

still the amount of skin we shed is not

small

but how much is it as a percentage of

household dust

well that turns out to be a trickier

question because there are a lot of

other sources of dust like

pollen fibers from rugs clothes and

furniture

dirt from outside even micro meteorites

dust from space

[Music]

to clear things up i called around to

some dust experts

and they pointed me to this book house

dust biology

by johanna van brunswick from 1981 and

sure enough on page 37 there is

this graph now it appears to show the

fraction of skin particles in

airborne dust as 80 except

not really this is a stacked area graph

so dead skin accounts for only 20

percent of dust particles between

100 and 300 micrometers could a simple

misunderstanding of this graph be the

source of the urban legend

i mean it's possible but what's more

interesting to me

is that the legend is not that far off

according to this a full

50 of dust particles under 100

micrometers

is dead human skin the book also reports

on a study

where they vacuumed a mattress and

studied the resulting dust ball under

the microscope

53 of the dust was skin particles

so the debunkers are debunked while not

70 to 80 percent dead skin cells do make

up a significant portion of household

dust

of course the exact percentage depends a

lot on how much other dust is

contributed by the environment

these studies were conducted in houses

in the netherlands which

typically have hardwood floors and

therefore less dust than homes with

carpeting

it also depends on how large of a

particle you consider

dust dead skin cells account for roughly

half

of the small dust particles but much

less than half of what is sucked up by

your vacuum cleaner

oh that is gross unbelievable

i guess it makes sense that the place

where we find the most dead skin cells

is

in and around our beds where we spend a

third of our lives

shedding a third of our skin in our

sleep

so then is it true that your mattress

actually doubles in weight every

10 years this claim was actually

published in a major news outlet 20

years ago

with the increase in mass attributed to

dust mites that feed on your dead skin

the claim which lacked a scientific

reference is so disgusting it has spread

throughout the internet

but it's not true if two people slept on

the same bed for a decade

and even if all their dead skin cells

ended up in the mattress

it would only gain around three

kilograms or seven pounds

and by conservation of mass the dust

mites that feed off that dead skin

could not weigh more than that so the

total weight gain would have to be less

than 10 percent the weight of an average

mattress

and remember dead skin cells are small

and light enough to become

airborne just making the bed has been

found to increase the number of skin

flakes in a cubic meter of air

from 21 000 to 107 000

skin scale dust is inevitable and it

occurs in higher quantities

where there are more people scientists

have studied the airborne dust in the

london underground and found that

fragments of dead skin cells

make up around 10 percent of all small

dust particles by weight

and it's not just skin we are shedding a

ton of tiny organisms

live on our bodies a teeming microbiome

of

bacteria fungi and mites every hour we

shed approximately one million

microbes in a cloud that spreads out a

radius of about 1 meter from

our bodies in one study an individual

was placed in a clean room for 90

minutes

scientists then identified who had been

in the room

not using their dna but rather using the

characteristic fingerprint of their

microbial cloud

the technique was so accurate the team

wrote that it

clearly suggests a forensic application

for indoor bioaerosols

meaning that one day we will likely use

microbial dust clouds to solve crimes

dust can reveal a lot about us because

a significant fraction of it literally

is us

i mean everyone has heard the expression

dust to dust but

they're probably not thinking about how

each and every day

part of us is becoming dust

you know when i was reading this house

dust biology book i found

some sections that sounded to me a

little bit like poetry

so studying uh dust from an office under

a light microscope

revealed tree fibers from paper eraser

dust

rubber calcite and pumice human hair

various dyed wools cottons and synthetic

fibers such as

nylon rayon cellulose triacetate and

orlon dander tobacco cigarette ashes

graphite

wood shavings oil soot paint chips

glue fingernail filings and traces of

quartz

and starch i love all these words

because they bring

vivid images to mind it's like the

tiniest fragments of our lives can paint

a full picture of reality

of who was there and what they did

you know searching through dust is a

little like searching the internet

there are so many pieces it's fuzzy

nebulous

but with the right tools and a bit of

perseverance i'm confident that

we can uncover the truth buried in there

in this case the truth is that dust

particularly these small particles and

dust around beds is mostly dead skin

why does that matter because it is

something we can be certain about

i mean for centuries science has beaten

back the shrouds

of ignorance and knowing what is really

true

is the only way we have been able to

make progress

the internet gives us a great

opportunity to

share that knowledge but only if someone

takes the time to

research and establish what really

is true

to perform a lot of this research i have

of course been using google

which might make you wonder how they

figure out what to show you in the first

place

well good news google is not a black box

they have an entire website that takes

you

under the hood of the search engine and

explains all the testing and

improvements they make

check it out by clicking the link in the

description and

when you go to make your next search try

it a few different ways

start broad don't include your answer in

the query use

image search and most importantly

remember google shows you the most

relevant information

it's up to you to decide what to do with

it
