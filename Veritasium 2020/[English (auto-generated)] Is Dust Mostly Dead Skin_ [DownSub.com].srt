2
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,120
this is me at the end of college

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,799
so anyway so today i'm packing up my

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,640
room is absolutely disgusting

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,960
uh there's dust all over the place

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,880
unbelievable how much dust this place

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,000
accumulates

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,480
just unreal 21 year old me was

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,640
apparently fascinated by dust

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,439
but where does it all come from well in

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,080
this video

12
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,840
we are going to get to the bottom of

13
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,160
this now this video was sponsored by

14
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,880
google

15
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,920
and when they approached me about

16
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,160
sponsoring a video i suggested i show

17
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,560
you

18
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,880
how i use google to research a complex

19
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,679
question

20
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,520
after all research is just research

21
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,760
anyway i couldn't pick a simple question

22
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,520
like how far away is the moon

23
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,840
how old is derek muller or how much wood

24
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,440
could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck

25
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,719
could chuck wood

26
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,920
because the video would be over already

27
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,879
but in the space of all possible queries

28
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,559
questions like these with clear

29
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,360
unambiguous answers are by far in the

30
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,320
minority

31
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,719
in fact of all the billions of search

32
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,640
queries typed into google every day

33
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,840
fully 15 are ones that google

34
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,040
has never even seen before so google

35
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,200
never actually gives you answers instead

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,119
in just a fraction of a second it uses

37
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,360
algorithms to select the most relevant

38
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,040
information from the hundreds of

39
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,759
billions of web pages it has indexed

40
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,759
what you do with that information is up

41
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,799
to you

42
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,119
so for this video i intentionally

43
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,280
selected something surrounded by

44
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,560
myths dust unbelievable

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,479
so a while back when i was filming a

46
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,680
different video a

47
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,799
phd scientist told me you know 70 of

48
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,880
household dust is dead skin

49
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,720
and i'd heard that before and chances

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,079
are you have two

51
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,799
if you type is dust into google the top

52
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,399
autocomplete result is

53
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,640
dead skin because that's one of the most

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,119
common ways people complete that query

55
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,680
but a quick scan of this page suggests

56
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,479
that the claim

57
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,439
is not true it's a misconception from

58
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,399
live science

59
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,479
sometimes a specific percentage of dust

60
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,680
is said to be dead skin

61
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,399
usually about 70 or 80 percent but

62
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,240
unless you're a molten bird or

63
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,719
reptile or you work in dr frankenstein's

64
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,600
laboratory

65
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,280
very little of your environment is

66
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
composed of dead body parts

67
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,920
or bbc science magazine which asks what

68
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,959
is dust made of

69
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,360
think it's human skin think again the

70
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,319
article says

71
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,160
it's a misconception that it's mostly

72
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,000
from outside the rest is

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,560
carpet fluff and clothes fibers and sure

74
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,160
enough all over the web you'll find

75
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,640
people debunking this idea

76
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,840
so is that it case closed hardly

77
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,000
i mean i'm not just gonna do one search

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,440
and call it a day

79
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,080
it's important to be aware of your own

80
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,040
biases

81
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,040
when i started this search the claim

82
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,080
seemed false

83
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,640
the idea that 70 to 80 of dust is dead

84
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,519
skin

85
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,760
it's exactly the sort of thing that is

86
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,599
gross enough to spread as an urban

87
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,400
legend

88
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
but it just seems implausible i mean if

89
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
most dust is dead skin

90
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,160
then why do abandoned buildings get

91
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,840
dusty over time

92
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,000
the debunking claims fit my

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,080
preconceptions so it would be easy to

94
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,280
stop here

95
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,120
but you got to be careful not just to

96
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,640
search to confirm what you already

97
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,280
thought

98
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,120
a common mistake people make is putting

99
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,720
the answer they are looking for

100
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,680
right in the search query looking more

101
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,400
closely

102
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
these websites lack scientific papers as

103
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,680
references

104
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,080
and i'm curious if the idea that 70 to

105
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,200
80 of dust

106
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,680
is dead skin if that's totally wrong

107
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,519
then how did the myth get started in the

108
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,640
first place

109
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,360
surely some dust must be dead skin but

110
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,319
how much

111
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,040
well a good strategy is to start broad

112
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,319
how do you define

113
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,560
dust exactly well dust is generally

114
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,519
defined as

115
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,519
particles that can become airborne for a

116
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,959
significant period of time

117
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,080
when perturbed by natural forces but how

118
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,400
long

119
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,280
is a significant period of time and what

120
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,680
are

121
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,640
natural forces exactly so the definition

122
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,519
of dust has

123
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,159
fuzzy boundaries kind of like dust

124
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,439
itself

125
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,439
if you ask the question how big is a

126
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,760
dust particle you get different answers

127
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,360
the international standardization

128
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,120
organization defines dust as any

129
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,760
particle smaller than 75 micrometers in

130
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,640
diameter

131
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,280
that's roughly the width of a human hair

132
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,040
the glossary of atmospheric chemistry

133
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,560
terms includes anything up to

134
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,840
100 micrometers but i've found several

135
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,798
papers that

136
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,959
include particles as large as two

137
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,238
millimeters

138
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,918
this large discrepancy is due to the

139
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,680
fact the most important property of a

140
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,720
dust particle

141
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,199
is not its size but its settling

142
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,160
velocity

143
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,240
which then determines how long it can

144
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,600
stay airborne

145
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,960
a 100 micrometer metal ball would fall

146
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,880
to the ground very quickly while a two

147
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
millimeter long cotton fiber could float

148
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,199
on

149
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,680
indoor air currents indefinitely so to

150
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,199
get around the different sizes

151
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,199
shapes and densities of dust particles

152
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,880
the international standardization

153
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,680
organization

154
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,320
has a way of calculating an effective

155
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,280
diameter

156
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,199
they define it as the diameter of a

157
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,680
hypothetical sphere of density one gram

158
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,960
per centimeter cubed

159
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,800
having the same terminal settling

160
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
velocity in calm

161
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,160
air as the particle in question

162
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,479
regardless of its geometric size

163
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,919
shape and true density

164
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,160
by any of these metrics a single human

165
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
skin cell with an average diameter of

166
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,600
around 30 micrometers

167
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,880
would count as dust so then how many

168
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,919
dead skin cells

169
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,080
are we shedding you'd think the average

170
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,520
rate of skin shedding would be well

171
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,320
established

172
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,880
but the internet is a tangled web of

173
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,120
misquotations and missing citations when

174
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,560
it comes to skin

175
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,000
in trying to answer this question i

176
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,160
found dozens of web articles saying we

177
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,440
shed anywhere between

178
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,880
30 000 skin cells per day to 300 000

179
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,560
skin cells per minute

180
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,479
and estimated weights of dead skin as

181
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,320
high as nine pounds a year

182
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,000
per person using google scholar a great

183
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,440
resource for searching published

184
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,479
scientific research

185
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,840
i was able to track down several

186
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,919
peer-reviewed sources that agreed on the

187
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,199
numbers

188
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,840
every hour you create about 20 million

189
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,199
new skin cells

190
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,600
as those new skin cells form they push

191
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,479
older cells

192
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,639
up through the layers of the epidermis

193
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,800
and over a period of weeks they flatten

194
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,120
out

195
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,039
and harden forming the barrier that

196
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,880
protects our bodies from the outside

197
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,840
world

198
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,080
ultimately these dead skin cells fall

199
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,120
off usually

200
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,319
one by one for healthy skin so we

201
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,440
are constantly molting like a snake we

202
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,520
just don't notice it because our skin

203
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,560
comes off one cell at a time

204
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,800
fun fact dead skin cells are shed more

205
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,479
rapidly from your forearms than from

206
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,199
your back

207
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,800
and more rapidly from your back than

208
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,720
from your abdomen and one of the ways

209
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,000
scientists have measured

210
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,160
these rates of skin shedding is actually

211
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,840
by taping containers

212
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,960
onto people's skin

213
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,360
and collecting up the dead skin cells

214
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,240
shed over at least a 48 hour period

215
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,960
yeah i'm gonna regret this based on

216
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,720
these measurements we know that each

217
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,280
square

218
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
centimeter of your body is shedding

219
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520
around a thousand dead skin cells per

220
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,120
hour

221
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,360
now the average adult body has a surface

222
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,880
area of nearly two

223
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,280
square meters meaning you are shedding

224
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,479
nearly 20

225
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,960
million dead skin cells per hour that

226
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,680
adds up to

227
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,639
half a billion dead skin cells per day

228
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,479
now half a billion dead skin cells

229
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,199
weigh between one and two grams that's

230
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:17,520
just

231
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,599
a little bit less than the weight of a

232
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,919
penny

233
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,639
over a year that means you shed half a

234
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,840
kilogram or over

235
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,039
a pound of dead skin if you want to

236
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,000
think about it another

237
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,880
way in a single year you give off around

238
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,560
180 billion

239
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,039
dead skin cells that's roughly the same

240
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:37,680
number

241
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,479
as there are stars in our milky way

242
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,400
galaxy

243
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,879
an average family of 2.6 people could

244
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,960
cover the entire horizontal surface of

245
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,879
an average 2 000 square foot home

246
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,759
with a layer of skin cells one cell deep

247
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,479
in around

248
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,440
200 days that is assuming all their dead

249
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,599
skin cells accumulate around the house

250
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,000
which of course is not true some will

251
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,520
come off in the shower and some will get

252
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,360
captured in clothes and bed sheets and

253
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,840
be

254
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,919
rinsed out in the wash not to mention

255
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,680
dead skin cells shed outside the home

256
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,000
still the amount of skin we shed is not

257
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,039
small

258
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,520
but how much is it as a percentage of

259
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,120
household dust

260
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,800
well that turns out to be a trickier

261
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,240
question because there are a lot of

262
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,599
other sources of dust like

263
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,919
pollen fibers from rugs clothes and

264
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:26,720
furniture

265
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,840
dirt from outside even micro meteorites

266
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,330
dust from space

267
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,599
[Music]

268
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,679
to clear things up i called around to

269
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,200
some dust experts

270
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,080
and they pointed me to this book house

271
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,200
dust biology

272
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,480
by johanna van brunswick from 1981 and

273
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,000
sure enough on page 37 there is

274
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,800
this graph now it appears to show the

275
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,480
fraction of skin particles in

276
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,000
airborne dust as 80 except

277
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,120
not really this is a stacked area graph

278
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,600
so dead skin accounts for only 20

279
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,519
percent of dust particles between

280
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,040
100 and 300 micrometers could a simple

281
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,959
misunderstanding of this graph be the

282
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,200
source of the urban legend

283
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,320
i mean it's possible but what's more

284
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,360
interesting to me

285
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,839
is that the legend is not that far off

286
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,360
according to this a full

287
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,920
50 of dust particles under 100

288
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,720
micrometers

289
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,320
is dead human skin the book also reports

290
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,959
on a study

291
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,720
where they vacuumed a mattress and

292
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,399
studied the resulting dust ball under

293
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,680
the microscope

294
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,279
53 of the dust was skin particles

295
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,560
so the debunkers are debunked while not

296
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,279
70 to 80 percent dead skin cells do make

297
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,360
up a significant portion of household

298
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,160
dust

299
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
of course the exact percentage depends a

300
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,920
lot on how much other dust is

301
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,000
contributed by the environment

302
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,839
these studies were conducted in houses

303
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,040
in the netherlands which

304
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,640
typically have hardwood floors and

305
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,800
therefore less dust than homes with

306
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,480
carpeting

307
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
it also depends on how large of a

308
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,920
particle you consider

309
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,040
dust dead skin cells account for roughly

310
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,440
half

311
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,000
of the small dust particles but much

312
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
less than half of what is sucked up by

313
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,959
your vacuum cleaner

314
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,560
oh that is gross unbelievable

315
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,000
i guess it makes sense that the place

316
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,079
where we find the most dead skin cells

317
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:20,399
is

318
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,279
in and around our beds where we spend a

319
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,560
third of our lives

320
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,440
shedding a third of our skin in our

321
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,399
sleep

322
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,560
so then is it true that your mattress

323
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,000
actually doubles in weight every

324
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,160
10 years this claim was actually

325
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
published in a major news outlet 20

326
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,200
years ago

327
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,279
with the increase in mass attributed to

328
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,920
dust mites that feed on your dead skin

329
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,160
the claim which lacked a scientific

330
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,480
reference is so disgusting it has spread

331
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,519
throughout the internet

332
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,640
but it's not true if two people slept on

333
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,160
the same bed for a decade

334
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,079
and even if all their dead skin cells

335
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,600
ended up in the mattress

336
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,120
it would only gain around three

337
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,200
kilograms or seven pounds

338
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,040
and by conservation of mass the dust

339
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
mites that feed off that dead skin

340
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,680
could not weigh more than that so the

341
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,279
total weight gain would have to be less

342
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,200
than 10 percent the weight of an average

343
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,240
mattress

344
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,800
and remember dead skin cells are small

345
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,000
and light enough to become

346
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,399
airborne just making the bed has been

347
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,079
found to increase the number of skin

348
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,920
flakes in a cubic meter of air

349
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,160
from 21 000 to 107 000

350
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,560
skin scale dust is inevitable and it

351
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,160
occurs in higher quantities

352
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,399
where there are more people scientists

353
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,920
have studied the airborne dust in the

354
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,519
london underground and found that

355
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,120
fragments of dead skin cells

356
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,440
make up around 10 percent of all small

357
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
dust particles by weight

358
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,240
and it's not just skin we are shedding a

359
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,920
ton of tiny organisms

360
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,040
live on our bodies a teeming microbiome

361
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,360
of

362
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,800
bacteria fungi and mites every hour we

363
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,639
shed approximately one million

364
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,120
microbes in a cloud that spreads out a

365
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,200
radius of about 1 meter from

366
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,920
our bodies in one study an individual

367
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,839
was placed in a clean room for 90

368
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:02,720
minutes

369
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,880
scientists then identified who had been

370
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,839
in the room

371
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,399
not using their dna but rather using the

372
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,240
characteristic fingerprint of their

373
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,000
microbial cloud

374
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,240
the technique was so accurate the team

375
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,120
wrote that it

376
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,440
clearly suggests a forensic application

377
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,279
for indoor bioaerosols

378
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,200
meaning that one day we will likely use

379
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,639
microbial dust clouds to solve crimes

380
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,839
dust can reveal a lot about us because

381
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,079
a significant fraction of it literally

382
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,279
is us

383
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,880
i mean everyone has heard the expression

384
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,320
dust to dust but

385
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,160
they're probably not thinking about how

386
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,360
each and every day

387
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,560
part of us is becoming dust

388
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,040
you know when i was reading this house

389
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,959
dust biology book i found

390
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,279
some sections that sounded to me a

391
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,880
little bit like poetry

392
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,200
so studying uh dust from an office under

393
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,560
a light microscope

394
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,079
revealed tree fibers from paper eraser

395
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:56,880
dust

396
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,480
rubber calcite and pumice human hair

397
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,279
various dyed wools cottons and synthetic

398
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,320
fibers such as

399
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,440
nylon rayon cellulose triacetate and

400
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,880
orlon dander tobacco cigarette ashes

401
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,920
graphite

402
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,959
wood shavings oil soot paint chips

403
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,839
glue fingernail filings and traces of

404
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,480
quartz

405
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,440
and starch i love all these words

406
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,880
because they bring

407
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,920
vivid images to mind it's like the

408
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,399
tiniest fragments of our lives can paint

409
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,639
a full picture of reality

410
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,760
of who was there and what they did

411
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,000
you know searching through dust is a

412
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,240
little like searching the internet

413
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,800
there are so many pieces it's fuzzy

414
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,079
nebulous

415
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,760
but with the right tools and a bit of

416
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
perseverance i'm confident that

417
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,760
we can uncover the truth buried in there

418
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,839
in this case the truth is that dust

419
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,920
particularly these small particles and

420
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,920
dust around beds is mostly dead skin

421
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,040
why does that matter because it is

422
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,800
something we can be certain about

423
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,040
i mean for centuries science has beaten

424
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,160
back the shrouds

425
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,720
of ignorance and knowing what is really

426
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,360
true

427
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,199
is the only way we have been able to

428
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,880
make progress

429
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
the internet gives us a great

430
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,000
opportunity to

431
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,800
share that knowledge but only if someone

432
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,720
takes the time to

433
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,920
research and establish what really

434
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:31,440
is true

435
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,600
to perform a lot of this research i have

436
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,279
of course been using google

437
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,040
which might make you wonder how they

438
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,800
figure out what to show you in the first

439
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,360
place

440
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,399
well good news google is not a black box

441
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,240
they have an entire website that takes

442
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,560
you

443
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,160
under the hood of the search engine and

444
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,600
explains all the testing and

445
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,880
improvements they make

446
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,720
check it out by clicking the link in the

447
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,240
description and

448
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,160
when you go to make your next search try

449
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,600
it a few different ways

450
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,839
start broad don't include your answer in

451
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:58,720
the query use

452
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,560
image search and most importantly

453
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,480
remember google shows you the most

454
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,680
relevant information

455
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,839
it's up to you to decide what to do with

456
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,880
it

457
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,480
thanks to google for sponsoring this
