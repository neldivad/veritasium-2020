00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,080
lastpass

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,399
this video is about a pattern people

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,919
thought was impossible

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,160
and a material that wasn't supposed to

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,440
exist

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,559
the story begins over 400 years ago

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,039
in prague i'm now in prague and the

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,800
czech republic which is perhaps my

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,480
favorite european city that i've visited

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,279
so far

12
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,960
i'm going to visit the kepler museum

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,400
because he's one of the most famous

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,320
scientists who lived and worked around

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,039
prague

16
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,960
i want to tell you five things about

17
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,240
johannes kepler

18
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,840
that are essential to our story

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,399
number one kepler is most famous for

20
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,600
figuring out that the shapes of

21
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,960
planetary orbits are

22
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,440
ellipses but before he came to this

23
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,320
realization

24
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,719
he invented a model of the solar system

25
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,800
in which the planets were on nested

26
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,760
spheres

27
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,920
separated by the platonic solids

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,239
what are the platonic solids well they

29
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,360
are objects where

30
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,000
all of the faces are identical and all

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,199
of the vertices

32
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,920
are identical which means you can rotate

33
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,800
them through some

34
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,119
angle and they look the same as they did

35
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,080
before

36
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,119
so the cube is an obvious example then

37
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,240
you also have

38
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,119
the tetrahedron the octahedron

39
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,400
the dodecahedron which has 12 pentagonal

40
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,200
sides

41
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,799
and the icosahedron which has 20 sides

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,119
and that's it there are just five

43
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,400
platonic solids

44
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,560
which was convenient for kepler because

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,000
in his day they only knew

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,560
about six planets so this allowed him to

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,799
put a unique platonic solid between

48
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,479
each of the planetary spheres

49
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,200
essentially he used them as spacers

50
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,280
he carefully selected the order of the

51
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,399
platonic solids

52
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,479
so that the distances between planets

53
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,799
would match astronomical observations as

54
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,560
closely as possible

55
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,960
he had this deep abiding belief that

56
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,960
there was some geometric regularity in

57
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,079
the universe

58
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,280
and of course there is just not this

59
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,840
two kepler's attraction to geometry

60
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,680
extended to more practical questions

61
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,320
like

62
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,000
how do you stack cannonballs so they

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,719
take up the least space on a ship's deck

64
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,080
by 1611 kepler had an answer hexagonal

65
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,120
close packing

66
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,599
and the face centered cubic arrangement

67
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,040
are both equivalently

68
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,440
and optimally efficient with cannonballs

69
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,000
occupying about 74 percent of the volume

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,040
they take up

71
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,879
now this might seem like the obvious way

72
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,800
to stack spheres i mean it is the way

73
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,760
that oranges

74
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,000
are stacked in the supermarket but

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,920
kepler hadn't proved it he just

76
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,319
stated it as fact which is why this

77
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,200
became known as kepler's conjecture

78
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,519
now it turns out he was right but it

79
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,400
took around

80
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,120
400 years to prove it the formal proof

81
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,640
was only published in the journal form

82
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,599
of mathematics

83
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,800
in 2017. three

84
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,879
kepler published his conjecture in a

85
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,519
pamphlet called deniva sexangula

86
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,160
on the six cornered snowflake in which

87
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,040
he wondered

88
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,959
there must be a definite cause why

89
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,959
whenever snow begins to fall

90
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,800
its initial formations invariably

91
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,720
display the shape of a six cornered

92
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,599
starlet

93
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,599
for if it happens by chance why do they

94
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,680
not fall just as well with five corners

95
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,959
or with seven

96
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,319
why always with six in kepler's day

97
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,560
there was no real theory of atoms or

98
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,879
molecules or how they self-arrange into

99
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,680
crystals

100
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,920
but kepler seemed to be on the verge of

101
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,120
understanding this

102
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,840
i mean he speculates about the smallest

103
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,159
natural unit of a liquid like water

104
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,640
essentially a water molecule and how

105
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,159
these tiny units could

106
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,400
stack together mechanically to form the

107
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,239
hexagonal crystal

108
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,879
not unlike the hexagonal close-packed

109
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,519
cannonballs

110
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,480
four kepler knew that regular hexagons

111
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,799
can cover a flat surface perfectly with

112
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,280
no gaps in mathematical jargon we say

113
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,200
the hexagon tiles the plane

114
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,840
periodically you know that a tiling is

115
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,560
periodic

116
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,799
if you can duplicate a portion of it and

117
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,560
continue the pattern only through

118
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,439
translation

119
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,319
with no rotations or reflections

120
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,080
periodic tilings can also have

121
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,519
rotational symmetry

122
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,680
a rhombus pattern has twofold symmetry

123
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,400
because if you rotate it 180 degrees one

124
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,280
half turn

125
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,040
the pattern looks the same as it did

126
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,840
before equilateral triangles have

127
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,760
three-fold symmetry

128
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,040
squares have four-fold symmetry and

129
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,240
hexagons have six-fold symmetry but

130
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,800
those

131
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,000
are the only symmetries you can have two

132
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,199
three four and six there is

133
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,800
no fivefold symmetry regular pentagons

134
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,120
do not tile the plane but that didn't

135
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,880
stop kepler from trying

136
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,840
see this pattern right here he published

137
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,080
it in his book harmonics mundi or

138
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,800
harmony of the world it has a certain

139
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
five-fold symmetry

140
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,400
but not exactly and it's not entirely

141
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,800
clear

142
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,040
how you would continue this pattern to

143
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,080
tile the whole plane

144
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,400
there are an infinite number of shapes

145
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,639
that can tile the plane periodically

146
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,039
the regular hexagon can only tile the

147
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,639
plane periodically

148
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,479
there are also an infinite number of

149
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,840
shapes that can tile the plane

150
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,800
periodically

151
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,360
or non-periodically for example

152
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
isosceles triangles can tile the plane

153
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,479
periodically

154
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,199
but if you rotate a pair of triangles

155
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,800
well then the pattern is no longer

156
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,560
perfectly periodic

157
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,039
a sphinx tile can join with another

158
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,199
rotate it at 180 degrees

159
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,840
and tile the plane periodically but a

160
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,520
different arrangement of these

161
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,720
same tiles is non-periodic

162
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,800
this raises the question are there some

163
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,759
tiles that can

164
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,960
only tile the plane non-periodically

165
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,000
well in 1961 how wang was studying

166
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,039
multi-colored square tiles the rules

167
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:45,520
were

168
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,440
touching edges must be the same color

169
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,000
and you can't rotate or reflect tiles

170
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,639
only slide them around now the question

171
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,199
was

172
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,360
if you're given a set of these tiles can

173
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,240
you tell

174
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,960
if they will tile the plane wang's

175
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,680
conjecture

176
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,919
was that if they can tile the plane well

177
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,240
they can do so periodically

178
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,039
but it turned out wang's conjecture was

179
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:07,919
false

180
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,880
his student robert berger found a set of

181
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,960
20

182
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,199
426 tiles that could tile the plane

183
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,479
but only non-periodically

184
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,319
think about that for a second here we

185
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,880
have a finite set of tiles okay it's a

186
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,840
large number

187
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,479
but it's finite and it can tile all the

188
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,000
way out to infinity

189
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,120
without ever repeating the same pattern

190
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,199
there's no way even to force them to

191
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,440
tile periodically

192
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,759
and a set of tiles like this that can

193
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,160
only tile the plane

194
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,240
non-periodically is called an aperiodic

195
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,440
tiling

196
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,759
and mathematicians wanted to know were

197
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,240
there aperiodic tilings that required

198
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,759
fewer tiles well robert berger himself

199
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,880
found a set with only 104 donald knuth

200
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,639
got the number down to 92

201
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,120
and then in 1969 you had raphael

202
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,560
robinson who came up with

203
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,160
six tiles just six that could tile the

204
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,199
entire plane without ever repeating

205
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,840
then along came roger penrose who would

206
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,919
ultimately get the number down to two

207
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,120
penrose started with a pentagon he added

208
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,479
other pentagons around it

209
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,039
and of course noticed the gaps but this

210
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:21,840
new shape

211
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,039
could fit within a larger pentagon which

212
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,919
gave penrose an idea what if he took the

213
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,199
original pentagons

214
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,560
and broke them into smaller pentagons

215
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,319
well now some of the gaps start

216
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,680
connecting up into

217
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,240
rhombus shapes other gaps have three

218
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,280
spikes

219
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,360
but penrose didn't stop there he

220
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,759
subdivided the pentagons again

221
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,520
now some of the gaps are large enough

222
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,599
that you can use pentagons to fill in

223
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,639
part of them

224
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,479
and the remaining holes you're left with

225
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,919
are just rhombuses

226
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,680
stars and a fraction of a star that

227
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,919
penrose calls a justice cap

228
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,160
you can keep subdividing indefinitely

229
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
and you will only ever find

230
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,440
these shapes so with just these pieces

231
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,919
you can tile the plane

232
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,000
aperiodically with an almost five-fold

233
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,240
symmetry

234
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,560
the fifth thing about johannes kepler is

235
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,960
that if you take his pentagon pattern

236
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,080
and you overlay it on top of penrose's

237
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,360
the two match up perfectly

238
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,800
[Music]

239
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,280
once penrose had his pattern he found

240
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,599
ways to simplify the tiles

241
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,680
he distilled the geometry down to just

242
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,840
two tiles a thick rhombus

243
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,880
and a thin rhombus the rules for how

244
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,399
they can come together can be enforced

245
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,000
by bumps and notches

246
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,479
or by matching colors and the rules

247
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,679
ensure that these

248
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,519
two single tiles can only tile the plane

249
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,080
non-periodically

250
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,320
just two tiles go all the way out to

251
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,279
infinity without

252
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,640
ever repeating now one way to see this

253
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,360
is to print up two copies of the same

254
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,720
penrose pattern

255
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,200
and one on a transparency and overlay

256
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,720
them on top of each other

257
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,880
now the resulting interference you get

258
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,160
is called a moire

259
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,040
pattern where it is dark the patterns

260
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,360
are

261
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,399
not aligned you can see there are

262
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,160
also some light spots and that's where

263
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,519
the patterns do

264
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,720
match up and as i rotate around you can

265
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,000
see the

266
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,800
light spots move in and get smaller and

267
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,000
then at a certain point

268
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,519
they move out and get bigger

269
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,080
and what i want to do is try to enlarge

270
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,600
one of these bright spots

271
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,880
and see how big of a matching section i

272
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,519
can find

273
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,959
oh yes yes it's like

274
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,640
all of a sudden everything is

275
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,480
illuminated i love it

276
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,800
so these patterns are perfectly matching

277
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,200
up here here here here and here but

278
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,480
not along these radial lines

279
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,360
and that is why they look dark so what

280
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,399
this shows us

281
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,200
is that you can't ever match any section

282
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,800
perfectly to one

283
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,600
beneath it there will always be some

284
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,839
difference

285
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,399
so my favorite penrose pattern is

286
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,440
actually made out of

287
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,279
these two shapes which are called kites

288
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,760
and darts and they have these very

289
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,360
particular angles

290
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,440
and the way they're meant to match up is

291
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,200
based on these two curves you can see

292
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,120
there's a curve on each piece

293
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,360
and so you have to connect them so that

294
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,440
the curves are continuous

295
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,880
and that's the rule that allows you to

296
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,399
build an aperiodic tiling from these two

297
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,440
pieces

298
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,200
so uh i laser cut thousands

299
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,480
of these pieces and oh i'm gonna

300
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,839
try to put them together and make a huge

301
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,880
penrose oh man

302
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,200
come on

303
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,480
if you stare at a pattern of kites and

304
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,959
darts you'll start to notice all kinds

305
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:55,440
of

306
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,519
regularities like stars and suns

307
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,920
but look closer and they don't quite

308
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,600
repeat in the way you'd expect them to

309
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,320
these two tiles create an ever-changing

310
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
pattern that extends out to infinity

311
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,800
without repeating does this mean

312
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,920
there is only one pattern of kites and

313
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,800
darts

314
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,360
and every picture that we see is just a

315
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,000
portion

316
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,680
of that overall singular pattern

317
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,360
well the answer is no there are actually

318
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,959
an uncountably infinite number of

319
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,279
different patterns of kites and darts

320
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,519
that tile the entire plane

321
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,640
and it gets weirder if you were on any

322
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,760
of those tilings

323
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,000
you wouldn't be able to tell which one

324
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,880
it is

325
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,560
i mean you might try to look further and

326
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,560
further out gather more and more data

327
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,120
but

328
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,560
it's futile because any finite region

329
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,880
of one of these tilings appears

330
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,399
infinitely many times

331
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,800
in all of the other versions of those

332
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,440
tilings

333
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,959
i mean don't get me wrong those tilings

334
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,480
are also different in

335
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,800
an infinite number of ways but it's

336
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,480
impossible to tell that unless you could

337
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,079
see the whole pattern

338
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,839
which is impossible

339
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,639
there's this kind of paradox to penrose

340
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,440
tilings

341
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,480
where there's an uncountable infinity

342
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,720
of different versions but just by

343
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,839
looking at them

344
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,839
you could never tell them apart

345
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,680
now what if we count up all the kites

346
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,519
and darts in this pattern

347
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,000
well i get 440 kites and 272

348
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,120
darts does that ratio ring any bells

349
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,040
well if you divide one by the other you

350
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,399
get 1.618

351
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,800
that is the golden ratio

352
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,360
so why does the golden ratio appear in

353
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,399
this pattern

354
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,040
well as you know it contains a kind of

355
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,560
five-fold symmetry

356
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,040
and of all the irrational constants the

357
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,160
golden ratio

358
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,200
phi is the most five-ish of the

359
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,720
constants i mean you can express the

360
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,079
golden ratio as

361
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,079
0.5 plus 5 to the power of 0.5

362
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,120
times 0.5 the golden ratio is also

363
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,279
heavily associated with pentagons

364
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,920
i mean the ratio of the diagonal to an

365
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,560
edge

366
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,120
is the golden ratio and the kite and

367
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,560
dart pieces themselves

368
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,200
are actually sections of pentagons same

369
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,240
with the rhombuses

370
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,480
so they actually have the golden ratio

371
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,360
built right

372
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,920
into their construction the fact that

373
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,839
the ratio of kites to darts approaches

374
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,079
the golden ratio an irrational number

375
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,079
provides evidence that the pattern can't

376
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,760
possibly be periodic

377
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,519
if the pattern were periodic then the

378
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,120
ratio of kites to darts

379
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,360
could be expressed as a ratio of two

380
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,399
whole numbers

381
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,079
the number of kites to darts in each

382
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,600
periodic segment

383
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,079
and it goes deeper if you draw on the

384
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:54,720
tiles

385
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,360
not curves but these particular straight

386
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,240
lines

387
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,680
well now when you put the pattern

388
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,720
together you see something interesting

389
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,199
they all connect up perfectly into

390
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,959
straight lines

391
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,800
there are five sets of parallel lines

392
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,360
this is a kind of proof of the five-fold

393
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
symmetry of the pattern

394
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,720
but it is not perfectly regular

395
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,800
take a look at any one set of parallel

396
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,480
lines you'll notice

397
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
there are two different spacings call

398
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,320
them long and short

399
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,279
from the bottom we have long short long

400
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,560
short long

401
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,480
long wait that breaks the pattern

402
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,120
these gaps don't follow a periodic

403
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,800
pattern either

404
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,720
but count up the number of longs and

405
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,240
shorts in any section

406
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,760
here i get 13 shorts and 21 longs

407
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,040
and you have the fibonacci sequence

408
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,399
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21

409
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,680
34 and so on and the ratio of

410
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,480
one fibonacci number to the previous one

411
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,760
approaches

412
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,800
the golden ratio

413
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,720
now the question penrose faced from

414
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,160
other scientists was

415
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,320
could there be a physical analog for

416
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,360
these patterns

417
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,600
do they occur in nature perhaps in

418
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,040
crystal structure

419
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,680
penrose thought that was unlikely the

420
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,680
very nature of a crystal is that it is

421
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,600
made up of repeating units

422
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,440
just as the fundamental symmetries of

423
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,199
the shapes that tile the plane had been

424
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,079
worked out much

425
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,560
earlier the basic unit cells that

426
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,199
compose

427
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,839
all crystals were well established there

428
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,120
are 14 of them

429
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,199
and no one had ever seen a crystal that

430
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,160
failed to fit

431
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,480
one of these patterns and there was

432
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,519
another problem

433
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,000
crystals are built by putting atoms and

434
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,360
molecules together

435
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,839
locally whereas penrose tilings well

436
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,600
they seem to require some sort of

437
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,759
long range coordination take this

438
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,360
pattern for example

439
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,480
you could put a dart over here

440
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,959
and continue to tile out to infinity no

441
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:57,759
problems

442
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,800
or you could put a kite

443
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,920
over here on the other side again no

444
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,040
problems

445
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,240
but if you place the kite

446
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,680
and dart in here simultaneously

447
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,720
well then this pattern will not work

448
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,759
i mean you can keep tiling for a while

449
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,839
but when you get to somewhere around

450
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,880
here

451
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,920
well it's not gonna work you can put a

452
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,519
dart in there which completes the

453
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,360
pattern nicely but then you get this

454
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,920
really awkward shape there which is

455
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,399
actually the shape of another dart

456
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,040
but if you put that one in there then

457
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,519
the

458
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,440
lines don't match up the pattern doesn't

459
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,320
work so how could this work as a crystal

460
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,399
i mean both of these tiles obey the

461
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,519
local rules

462
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,519
but in the long term they just don't

463
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,920
work in the early 1980s

464
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,759
paul steinhardt and his students were

465
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,320
using computers to model how atoms come

466
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,240
together into condensed matter

467
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,399
that is essentially solid material at

468
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,160
the smallest scales

469
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,399
and he found that locally they like to

470
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,320
form icosahedrons

471
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,559
but this was known to be the most

472
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,720
forbidden shape because it is full

473
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,359
of five-fold symmetries so the question

474
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,480
they posed was

475
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,119
how big can these zykosahedrons get they

476
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,720
thought maybe 10 atoms or

477
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,359
100 atoms but inspired by penrose

478
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,000
tilings

479
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,319
they designed a new kind of structure a

480
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,799
3d analog of penrose tilings now known

481
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,319
as a quasi-crystal

482
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,799
and they simulated how x-rays would

483
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,480
diffract off such a structure

484
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,320
and they found a pattern with rings of

485
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,480
10 points reflecting the five-fold

486
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,520
symmetry

487
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,360
just a few hundred kilometers away

488
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
completely unaware of their work another

489
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,320
scientist dan

490
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,120
schechtman created this flaky material

491
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,600
from

492
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,080
aluminum and manganese and when he

493
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,559
scattered electrons off his material

494
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,600
this is the picture he got it

495
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,400
almost perfectly matches the one made by

496
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,039
steinhardt

497
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,000
so if penrose tilings require long

498
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,480
range coordination then how do you

499
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,440
possibly make

500
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,080
quasi crystals well i was talking to

501
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,840
paul steinhardt about this and he told

502
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,400
me

503
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,960
if you just use the matching rules on

504
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,919
the edges

505
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,400
those rules are not strong enough and if

506
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,919
you apply them locally you run into

507
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,679
problems like this you misplace

508
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,640
tiles but he said if you have rules for

509
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,559
the vertices the way the vertices can

510
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,440
connect with each other those rules are

511
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,320
strong enough

512
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,200
locally so that you never make a mistake

513
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,919
and the pattern

514
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,120
can go on to infinity one of the seminal

515
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,799
papers on quasi crystals

516
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,840
was called deniva quinquangula

517
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,720
on the pentagonal snowflake in a shout

518
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,200
out

519
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,000
to kepler now not everyone was delighted

520
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,840
at the announcement of quasi crystals a

521
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,280
material that up until then people

522
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,679
thought

523
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,960
totally defied the laws of nature double

524
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,240
nobel prize winner

525
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,960
linus pauling famously remarked there

526
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,880
are no quasi crystals

527
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,799
only quasi scientists

528
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,760
but uh schechtman got the last laugh he

529
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,360
was awarded the nobel prize for

530
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,280
chemistry in 2011

531
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,039
and quasi crystals have since been grown

532
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,080
with beautiful dodecahedral shapes

533
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,919
they are currently being explored for

534
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,120
applications from

535
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,120
non-stick electrical insulation and

536
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,240
cookware to

537
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,960
ultra durable steel and the thing about

538
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,799
this whole story that fascinates me the

539
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,200
most

540
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
is what exists that we just can't

541
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,720
perceive because it's considered

542
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,600
impossible

543
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,360
i mean the symmetries of regular

544
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,880
geometric shapes seemed

545
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,120
so obvious and certain that no one

546
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,880
thought to look beyond them

547
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,760
that is until penrose and what we found

548
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,000
are

549
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,160
patterns that are both beautiful and

550
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,360
counter-intuitive

551
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,240
and materials that existed all along

552
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,919
that we just couldn't see

553
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:53,280
for what they really are

554
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,720
hey this portion of the video was

555
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,400
sponsored by lastpass and

556
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,840
they have sponsored a number of my

557
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,760
videos in the past which tells me two

558
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,480
things

559
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,960
number one many of you have signed up so

560
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,919
you don't have to remember your

561
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,159
passwords anymore or worry about getting

562
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,679
locked out of your accounts

563
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,159
and number two some of you have not yet

564
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:10,720
signed up

565
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,400
hence this reminder that your accounts

566
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
will be more secure and your brain

567
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,760
less cluttered when you put your

568
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,159
passwords on autopilot with lastpass

569
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,320
they give you unlimited password storage

570
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,600
free cross-device sync

571
