lutron

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,039
according to the general theory of

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,920
relativity gravity is not a force

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,720
there are no gravitational fields

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,519
gravity

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,119
is kind of an illusion and in this video

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,840
i will prove it to you by blasting off

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,440
into outer space

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:45,840

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,320
albert einstein said the happiest

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,920
thought of his life

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,039
was imagining a man falling off the roof

17
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,039
of a house

18
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,680
what made einstein so happy about this

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,960
wasn't shot in freuda

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,199
it was the realization that this man

21
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,560
while he was falling

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,040
wouldn't feel his own weight he would be

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,000
weightless

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,159
and anything he dropped on his way down

25
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,479
well it would remain stationary relative

26
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:14,960
to him

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,080
or moving in uniform motion

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,119
the whole situation would be just

29
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,960
like if you were in deep space

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,479
not near any large masses

31
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,280
with your spaceship at rest or coasting

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,320
along at constant velocity

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,520
here you would feel no weight

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,759
objects would remain stationary relative

35
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,640
to you

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,720
or if you give them a push they would

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
move in a straight line at constant

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,159
velocity

39
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,720
and you would be the very definition of

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,560
an inertial observer

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,720
you're not accelerating not in a

42
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,079
gravitational field

43
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,399
all the laws of physics apply in your

44
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,600
reference frame

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,000
meaning there is no experiment you could

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,360
do to distinguish

47
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,680
your inertial reference frame from any

48
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,920
other

49
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,520
now here comes the big leap einstein

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,920
looks at these two scenarios and says

51
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,959
they are equivalent not just similar

52
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,959
physically they are exactly the same

53
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,480
thing which means

54
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,319
man falling from roof is not in a

55
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,000
gravitational field there are no

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,360
gravitational fields

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,319
and he is not accelerating he is an

58
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,440
inertial observer

59
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,959
just like rocket man whoa whoa whoa

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,760
i mean okay i can see how both of these

61
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,560
observers

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,040
feel weightless but man falling from

63
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,040
roof is clearly in a gravitational field

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,000
i mean he's right

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,480
next to the earth and he's obviously

66
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,440
accelerating

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,599
his speed is increasing by 9.8 meters

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,280
per second every second a fact

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,120
that will become painfully apparent when

70
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,280
he crashes into the ground

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,840
i know that these two situations look

72
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,879
very different

73
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,560
but einstein's equivalence principle

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,920
tells us the one

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,400
thing to focus on the experience of the

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,360
observer

77
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,159
if they feel weightless then they are in

78
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,599
an inertial frame of reference

79
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,680
every bit as good as rocket man's out

80
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,840
drifting through deep space

81
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,080
imagine if rocket man coasting along at

82
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360
constant velocity

83
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,680
and not paying attention comes upon a

84
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,840
planet a long way off in the distance

85
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,639
[Music]

86
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,560
an external observer might notice that

87
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,400
the path of the rocket bends ever so

88
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,319
slightly towards the planet

89
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,959
but inside rocket man would remain

90
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,000
oblivious

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,720
he feels no force experiences no

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,840
acceleration

93
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,519
as the rocket gets closer to the planet

94
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,440
it goes faster and faster

95
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,920
but rocketman still feels weightless for

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,319
him nothing has changed

97
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,680
so where on this journey would you say

98
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,280
the frame of reference changes from

99
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,879
inertial to non-inertial

100
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,799
an on-board accelerometer would never

101
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,799
even register a blip

102
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,120
he has continued on his inertial path

103
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,040
through space-time

104
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,200
so the logical conclusion is his frame

105
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,280
of reference is inertial up until the

106
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,040
instant he crashes into the planet

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,400
okay so how do you explain the curved

108
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,760
path of his rocket without

109
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,519
gravitational forces or gravitational

110
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,199
fields the answer

111
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,479
is curved space time first focus on

112
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,240
rocketman's observation that the whole

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,800
time

114
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,720
he felt like he was moving with constant

115
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,000
velocity in a straight

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,120
line he was moving in a straight line

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,400
through space-time

118
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,240
but space-time around massive objects

119
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,160
like planets is curved

120
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,400
so that's why his path appeared curved

121
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,040
to a distant observer

122
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,680
now this isn't as unusual as it seems

123
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,759
airplanes for example always try to fly

124
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,680
the shortest route between cities

125
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,280
essentially they just go in a straight

126
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,600
line but since the earth's surface is

127
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,040
curved the shortest path

128
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,759
doesn't look like a straight line these

129
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,759
shortest paths over curved surfaces

130
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,240
are called geodesics and we use that

131
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,120
same word

132
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,440
geodesics for the straight line paths

133
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,280
followed by inertial observers through

134
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,880
curved spacetime

135
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,520
here's another analogy imagine you and a

136
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,080
friend

137
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,320
are standing a thousand kilometers apart

138
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,680
on the equator

139
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,880
now you both set off due north over time

140
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,880
you will come closer together ultimately

141
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,479
bumping into each other at the north

142
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,280
pole

143
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,680
it's as though there was a force pushing

144
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,880
you together

145
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,800
but you didn't feel a force and your

146
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,720
friend didn't feel a force

147
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,280
gravity is just like that force it

148
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,400
doesn't actually

149
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,280
exist the real reason for you coming

150
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,919
together

151
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,240
was that you were both on straight paths

152
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,120
geodesics

153
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,400
on a curved surface

154
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
astronauts on the space station are

155
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,000
weightless

156
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,160
that means they too are inertial

157
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,880
observers traveling on a geodesic

158
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,680
but the earth curves space-time around

159
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,080
it

160
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,319
which is why their straight-line path

161
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,160
appears as a helix

162
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,240
it only looks like a circular orbit if

163
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,479
you forget the time dimension

164
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,240
don't forget we are all moving through

165
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,319
space and time

166
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,120
space time

167
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,720
this is the standard bent sheet analogy

168
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,120
for

169
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,759
curved space-time but i think this demo

170
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,800
is misleading

171
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,479
it allows you to fool yourself into

172
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,840
thinking you understand general

173
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,800
relativity

174
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,479
when the intuition you're actually

175
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,160
drawing on is just that

176
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,720
objects like to fall towards the middle

177
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,759
of a well

178
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,240
due to the gravitational force but in

179
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,280
general relativity

180
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,000
there is no gravitational force what you

181
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,039
should be thinking about is

182
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,440
objects traveling on a straight line

183
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,960
path through space-time

184
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,280
it just so happens that space-time is

185
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,639
curved around massive

186
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,440
objects so that straight-line path

187
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,160
doesn't look like a straight line

188
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,720
matter tells space time how to curve and

189
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,639
space time tells matter how to move

190
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,000
now let's go back to deep space what

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,800
happens

192
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,880
if you turn on the rocket thrusters and

193
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,840
accelerate

194
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,680
at 9.8 meters per second squared

195
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,000
well someone outside would see all

196
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,960
objects remain

197
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,840
stationary while the floor of the rocket

198
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,880
accelerates

199
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,840
into them

200
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,400
[Music]

201
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
inside the rocket everything would

202
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,280
appear to accelerate down to the ground

203
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,520
and you would feel a force pushing up on

204
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,639
your feet

205
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,199
the same force that's pushing up on you

206
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,160
as you watch this video

207
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,479
this situation feels exactly the same as

208
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,759
being at rest

209
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,680
on the surface of earth

210
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,360
because we are at rest on the surface of

211
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,039
earth

212
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,520
now i want to ask you are you watching

213
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,440
this video in an inertial frame of

214
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,560
reference

215
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,680
well i mean do you feel weightless

216
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,199
no so you are not an inertial observer

217
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,039
your situation is exactly the same as

218
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,479
someone accelerating

219
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,879
on a rocket ship in deep space and let

220
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,560
me be clear i don't mean

221
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,319
that being at rest in a gravitational

222
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,400
field is like accelerating in a rocket

223
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,360
i mean it is the exact same thing you

224
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,199
are accelerating and there is no

225
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,479
gravitational field

226
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,120
gravitational fields do not exist now i

227
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,479
know that sounds crazy

228
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,840
but come with me for a minute

229
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,080
this is you in standard newtonian

230
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,719
physics

231
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,839
we draw your weight force the force of

232
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:40,559
gravity

233
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,120
pushing you down and the normal force

234
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,959
from the floor pushing you up

235
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,120
we say these forces are equal and

236
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,959
opposite so there's no net force on you

237
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:49,839
so you are not

238
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,120
accelerating but in general relativity

239
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,560
gravity is not a force you have

240
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,519
no weight so the only force on you are

241
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,680
these normal forces pushing you up

242
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,480
so you are accelerating upwards but i'm

243
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,040
not

244
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,920
moving up relative to what i mean

245
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,760
relative to the flip chart and the floor

246
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,519
and basically everything in this room

247
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,360
but all of those things are in your

248
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,519
frame of reference which you know is not

249
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,640
inertial

250
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,360
relative to everything in my rocket ship

251
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,560
i'm not accelerating

252
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,800
what you need if you really want to

253
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,160
measure your acceleration

254
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,920
is someone in an inertial frame of

255
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,080
reference like the guy who fell off the

256
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,279
roof

257
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,920
and he would see you accelerating up at

258
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,800
9.8

259
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,320
meters per second squared i think

260
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,640
what this shows is that what an

261
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,399
acceleration really is

262
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,080
is it's a deviation from a geodesic

263
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,640
you can't follow a straight-line path

264
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,080
through space-time

265
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,760
because the floor prevents you from

266
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,920
doing that it applies a force upwards on

267
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,320
you

268
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,440
so you're accelerating up but if i'm

269
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,399
accelerating up

270
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,640
and so is everyone else around the world

271
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,399
and presumably the whole surface of the

272
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,040
earth

273
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,160
then shouldn't the earth be expanding

274
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,640
no it is possible for you to be

275
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,680
accelerating

276
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,920
even though your spatial coordinates are

277
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,120
not changing

278
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,040
i will show you one equation from

279
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,279
general relativity

280
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,079
this says that the second derivative of

281
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,079
your position with respect to time

282
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,480
is equal to your acceleration that's

283
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,279
just f

284
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,640
on m and if you were in flat space time

285
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,560
well this is exactly what you're saying

286
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,160
if you're accelerating your spatial

287
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
coordinates have to change

288
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,040
but you're not in flat space time and

289
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,360
this term is related to the curvature of

290
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,320
space time

291
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,880
and this is your velocity through time

292
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,240
squared

293
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,680
you don't have to worry about the

294
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,519
details here the point

295
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,320
is your position can be not changing

296
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,800
this

297
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,600
can be zero which means your

298
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,800
acceleration

299
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,240
must be exactly equal to this

300
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,560
this curvature term times your velocity

301
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,440
through time

302
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,560
squared so in curved space time

303
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,600
you need to accelerate just to stand

304
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,920
still

305
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,480
a lot of this may seem more complicated

306
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,399
than newtonian physics but

307
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,959
one classical mystery looks a whole lot

308
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,959
simpler in general relativity

309
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,600
which is why all objects fall at the

310
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,240
same rate

311
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,880
now i have made a number of videos on

312
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,079
this topic and

313
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,519
i would always give the standard

314
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,920
newtonian explanation the only force on

315
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,600
a free-falling body is its weight

316
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,640
gmm on r squared which equals its mass

317
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,000
times acceleration

318
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,079
you can cancel the object's mass on both

319
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,279
sides of the equation

320
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,000
hence all objects will have this same

321
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,519
acceleration

322
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,399
the mystery is why we could cancel these

323
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:48,800
two

324
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,880
m's the one on the left was

325
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,800
gravitational mass the property of an

326
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,360
object

327
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,959
that creates and experiences a

328
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,480
gravitational field

329
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,639
while the m on the right is inertial

330
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,160
mass a measure of

331
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,200
resistance to acceleration why should

332
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,000
these two

333
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,480
conceptually different properties be

334
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,519
numerically

335
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,880
identical scientists have spent a lot of

336
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,680
time and effort

337
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,000
experimentally testing down to around

338
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,839
one part in 10 trillion

339
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,560
that these two types of mass really are

340
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,240
the same

341
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,720
but in general relativity there is no

342
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,760
mystery

343
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,600
all objects appear to fall the same way

344
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,200
because they're not

345
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,120
accelerating they're just following

346
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,800
straight-line paths through space-time

347
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,160
until they encounter something that

348
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,360
stops them

349
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,519
like the objects in the rocket ship they

350
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,600
appear to accelerate at the same rate

351
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,320
because

352
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
they're not really accelerating it's the

353
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,839
floor accelerating

354
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,519
into them now a lot of this might seem

355
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,360
pretty far-fetched as it did back in

356
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,920
1915 when einstein proposed it

357
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
so he very cleverly came up with a

358
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,680
measurable prediction that scientists

359
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,920
could make to test his theory

360
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,839
imagine that this rocket ship is

361
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,160
coasting through deep space

362
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,720
if you shine a light beam across the

363
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,600
rocket ship

364
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,440
well it'll do exactly what you expect

365
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,360
light travels in a straight line

366
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,519
and hits a point on the opposite wall at

367
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,920
exactly the same height as the source

368
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
but now what if this rocket is

369
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,120
accelerating

370
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,279
well to an external observer they're

371
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,560
still going to see the same thing

372
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,360
light traveling in a straight line but

373
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
inside the rocket

374
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,040
during the time it takes for the light

375
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,360
to travel across the cabin

376
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,959
the rocket will have sped up so by the

377
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,120
time it hits the other wall

378
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,240
it'll hit a little lower than before

379
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,200
so in an accelerating frame of reference

380
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,760
light

381
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,079
deflects down here i am dramatically

382
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,680
exaggerating the effect

383
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,399
even if i were accelerating up at 10 g's

384
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,040
which would

385
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,199
probably kill me the deflection would be

386
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,560
on the order of the width of a proton

387
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,519
still it shows that an accelerating

388
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,720
frame of reference

389
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,839
will bend light so einstein reasoned

390
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,399
light must also bend when it passes a

391
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:02,959
large

392
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,839
mass but where do you find a mass large

393
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:06,880
enough

394
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,240
well the only obvious huge mass near the

395
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,160
earth is the sun

396
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,399
so the ideal experiment would be to look

397
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,240
at light passing just

398
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,399
next to the sun and see if it is

399
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,279
deflected

400
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,639
say light from distant stars the problem

401
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,560
was of course the sun is just so bright

402
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,120
you can't see stars right next to it

403
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,480
unless there is a total solar eclipse

404
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,959
which is exactly what happened in 1919

405
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,959
so arthur eddington set out

406
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,680
to take pictures of the stars right next

407
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,720
to the sun

408
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,079
during totality and what he found by

409
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,839
analyzing those pictures was that their

410
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:44,720
positions

411
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,760
appeared deflected by the precise amount

412
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,240
predicted by einstein's general theory

413
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,519
of relativity

414
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,839
the result was twice the deflection some

415
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,360
had calculated using a strictly

416
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,720
newtonian model

417
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,480
in general relativity has passed

418
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,760
virtually every test

419
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,600
put to it over the past hundred years or

420
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
so but there are still

421
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,720
more things to try

422
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,440
[Music]

423
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,000
a well-known and empirically validated

424
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,800
finding

425
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,360
is that accelerating charges radiate

426
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
electromagnetic radiation

427
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,000
so one conceptually simple experimental

428
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,560
test

429
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,959
would be to compare the behavior of a

430
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,720
stationary charge in a gravitational

431
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,440
field to

432
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,560
a free falling one if a more newtonian

433
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,480
picture of gravity is correct

434
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,480
well then the stationary charge should

435
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,720
not radiate electromagnetic radiation

436
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,040
but a free falling one is accelerating

437
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,120
and therefore it should radiate

438
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,240
in contrast general relativity sees the

439
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,839
free falling charge as

440
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,680
non-accelerating it's just going on a

441
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,040
straight line path through curved

442
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,000
space-time

443
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,560
whereas the stationary charge is

444
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,920
accelerating and therefore

445
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,000
it should give off electromagnetic

446
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,279
radiation

447
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,519
now thus far logistical challenges have

448
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,279
prevented anyone from actually carrying

449
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,480
out this experiment

450
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,440
but what you believe will happen reveals

451
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,279
what you truly think

452
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,800
about the nature of gravity do you think

453
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,639
that a freely falling charge will

454
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,959
radiate electromagnetic radiation

455
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,160
or not is gravity an illusion

456
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,240
this episode was sponsored by caseta and

457
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,639
so i used the sponsorship money

458
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,079
to have a rocket ship built

459
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,160
caseta by lutron makes these smart light

460
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,680
switches in the rocket ship

461
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,079
they also make remotes motion sensors

462
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,600
smart plugs basically

463
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,279
every smart switch you could use for

464
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,199
turning things in your home on and

465
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,000
off but installing a smart switch isn't

466
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,279
rocket science

467
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,120
just turn off the power to the switch

468
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,800
detach the existing wires

469
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,639
and reconnect them to the caseta smart

470
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,800
switch what's great about smart switches

471
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,560
as opposed to smart bulbs

472
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,199
is one switch often controls multiple

473
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:57,920
bulbs

474
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,839
so you can save money by replacing only

475
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,160
the switch and they connect to most

476
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
smart devices like alexa google

477
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,959
assistant

478
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,520
and apple home kit and you can control

479
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,319
them via an

480
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,959
app on your phone so if you forget to

481
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,799
turn off the lights in the rocket

482
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,880
no need to go back just turn them off in

483
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,119
the app you can also use the app to set

484
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,079
up schedules

485
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,319
turning the lights on when it goes dark

486
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,919
this gives you peace of mind knowing

487
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,760
your family will always come home to a

488
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,119
well-lit house

489
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,119
now we may not have personal rockets yet

490
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,840
but we have smart switches and the smart

491
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,120
choice for these devices

492
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,200
is caseta by lutron
