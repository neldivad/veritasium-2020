during the covid lockdown this headline

went viral

nearly half of men say they do most of

the homeschooling

three percent of women agree i bring

this

up not to debate who's right but because

it's a great example of something called

egocentric bias most people think they

do

most of the work for example researchers

have asked authors of

multi-author papers what percentage of

the work they personally did

and when they add up those percentages

the sum is on average 140 percent

when couples are asked to estimate how

much of the housework they do the

combined total is almost always

over a hundred percent now you might

think this is because people want to

appear

more helpful than they actually are but

that's not it

when couples are asked what fraction of

the fights they start or how much of the

mess is theirs

the total is again over a hundred people

think they do more of the work

but they also think they cause more of

the problems so why is this

i think it's simply because you

experience and remember vividly all of

what you do

but not all of what everyone else does

so naturally you overestimate your own

contributions and

underestimate others and i think this

bias

leads us to underestimate the influence

of other things on our lives like

the role luck plays in our success take

hockey players for example

if you ask a professional hockey player

how they managed to reach the nhl

they might mention their hard work

determination great coaches their

parents willingness to get up at 5am and

so on

but they probably won't acknowledge how

lucky they were to be born

in january and yet in many years 40

of hockey players selected into top tier

leagues are born in the first quarter of

the year

compared to just 10 percent in the

fourth quarter an

early birthday can make you up to four

times as likely to be a pro hockey

player

and the reason for this disparity is

presumably because the cutoff date for

kids hockey leagues is january 1st

those born in the first part of the year

are a little older and so on average

bigger and faster than kids in their

league born

late in the year now as they grow up

this difference should eventually shrink

to nothing

but it doesn't because the young kids

who share the most promise are given

more time on the ice and enter more

tournaments where they receive better

coaching and improve their skills

and these advantages compound year after

year so by the time you get to the pros

birthdays are heavily skewed towards the

start of the year

but does any professional hockey player

feel thankful for their birthday

probably not and we are all like that

largely oblivious to the fortunate

events that support our success

probably the most significant bit of

luck many of us enjoy is being born into

a prosperous country

around half the variance in income

received by people around the world is

explained by their country of residence

and that country's income distribution

if you were born in burundi for example

which has the world's

lowest gross national income per capita

of just 730

a year it doesn't matter how smart or

hard-working you are

you're unlikely to earn much as an adult

now many people get offended if you

point out how big a role chance plays in

their success

and i get it if we are just a product of

our circumstances

then our hard work and our talent seem

to count for nothing

people think it has to be either skill

or luck

that explains success but the truth is

you need both

take these eight track and field world

records all the athletes who achieve

these records are obviously

world class extremely dedicated and

talented and yet

when they achieved their world records

seven out of eight had a tailwind

now these athletes all had the ability

to win a gold medal but to set the world

record

required a bit of luck as well the

importance of luck increases the greater

the number of applicants

applying for just a few spaces consider

the most recent class of nasa astronauts

from over 18 300 applicants in 2017

only 11 were selected and went on to

graduate from the astronaut training

program

now we can make a toy model of the

selection process

let's assume that astronauts are

selected mostly based on skill

experience and hard work but also say

five percent

as a result of luck fortunate

circumstances

for each applicant i randomly generated

a skill score out of a hundred

and i also randomly generated a luck

score out of a hundred

then i added those numbers together

weighted in the 95

to 5 ratio to get an overall score

this score represents the selector's

judgments meaning the top 11 by this

metric

would become astronauts and i repeated

this simulation a thousand times

representing

a thousand different astronaut

selections and what i found was

the astronauts who were picked were very

lucky

they had an average luck score of 94.7

so how many of the selected astronauts

would have been in the top 11 based on

skill

alone the answer was on average only 1.6

that means even with luck accounting for

just 5

of the outcome 9 or maybe 10 of the 11

applicants selected

would have been different if luck played

no role at all

when competition is fierce being

talented and hardworking is important

but it's not enough to guarantee success

you also need to catch a break

largely i think we're unaware of our

good luck because by definition it's not

something we did

like the housework done by your

significant other it goes unappreciated

and here's the crazy thing downplaying

the importance of chance events may

actually

improve your probability of success

because

if you perceive an outcome to be

uncertain you're less likely to invest

effort in it which further decreases

your chances of success

so it's a useful delusion to believe you

are in full control of your destiny

i mean if i had known how bad i was when

i started youtube or how much work it

would take

i might have given up right then welcome

to veritasium

an online science video blog now there

may be another benefit to overlooking

your lucky breaks which is

it makes it easier to justify your place

in society

if you have a lot of wealth or power you

can just chalk it up to your own

intelligence effort and perseverance it

makes it easier to accept inequality

in one experiment participants were put

in groups of three in small rooms to

discuss a complex moral problem and one

person in each group was randomly

designated the team leader

half an hour later the experimenter came

by with four cookies for each team

so who got the extra cookie in each case

it went to the team leader

even though they had no special aptitude

they didn't have extra responsibilities

and they'd gotten their position through

chance alone

once you have achieved a certain status

it seems natural to feel like you

deserve it and

all the other good things that come your

way now this is just an anecdote but

whenever i've been upgraded to fly a

business class

i've always observed the worst behavior

in my fellow privileged passengers they

just act so entitled and uncourteous and

research has found evidence for this as

well in another experiment participants

were asked to think of a good thing that

happened to them recently

and then one group was asked to list

their own personal qualities or actions

that made that good thing happen

another group was asked to list external

factors beyond their control

that led to the event and a control

group was simply asked to list reasons

why the good thing happened

now for completing this task

participants were told they would be

paid a dollar

but at the end they were offered the

option to donate some or

all of the money to a charity results

showed those who listed their own

personal attributes contributed

25 less than those who listed external

factors beyond their control

now think of what all this means for

people in our society specifically for

people in positions of power like

business leaders and politicians now

undoubtedly most of them

are talented and hardworking but they

have also been luckier than most

and like most of us they don't realize

just how lucky they are

and this gives them a distorted view of

reality they're kind of

living in a form of survivor bias all

these leaders have worked hard and

ultimately succeeded so

to them the world appears fair in their

experience it rewards hard work

but what they don't have is the

experience of all the people who have

worked hard

and failed so what are they to make of

people less successful than themselves

well the natural conclusion is that

they must just be less talented or less

hard-working

and this perspective makes them less

inclined to be generous to give back

and they are the ones who set the rules

for how society operates

and this is particularly unfortunate

since one of the main ways many of us

are lucky

is in our country of residence but what

is a country

except for the things put there by

people who came before the

roads and the schools public transport

emergency services clean air and water

everything like that it seems a cruel

trick of our psychology that

successful people without any malice

will credit their success largely to

their

own hard work and ingenuity and

therefore contribute less to maintaining

the very

circumstances that made that success

possible in the first place

the good news is that acknowledging our

fortunate circumstances

not only brings us more in line with

reality it also makes us more likeable

in a study where people had to read the

transcript of a fictional 60 minutes

interview with a biotech entrepreneur

experimenters tried changing just the

last paragraph where the interviewee

is talking about the reasons for their

company's success in one version the

entrepreneur

personally takes credit for the success

they've had but in the other

he says luck played a significant role

now people who read the luck version of

the transcript

judged the entrepreneur as kinder and

thought they'd be more likely to be

close friends with him than those who

read the other version of the transcript

and raising our awareness of fortunate

events can also make us happier

because it allows us to feel gratitude

personally i am grateful to michael

stevens of vsauce who on october 7th

2012

posted the video how much does a shadow

weigh which shouts out my slow-motion

slinky drop video

and within three days my subscribers had

increased by a third and within a month

they had doubled leading me to quit my

part-time job and work exclusively on

youtube videos

and i'm grateful to the writer of the

free newspaper they give out on the

trains in sydney who didn't quite

understand electricity

leading me to post this picture of their

article to my instagram with the caption

what's wrong with this picture and i'm

lucky that the first person to answer

correctly

was a beautiful woman who became my

future wife

yep that is how i met your mother

now initially i wanted to make this

video just to say our circumstances and

psychology conspire to make us oblivious

to our own luck

this leads successful people to view the

world as fair and those less successful

than them as less talented or

less hardworking and this is before you

factor in any discrimination or

prejudice

but it also became apparent to me that i

should talk about what to do if you want

to be successful in such a world and i

think the best advice

is paradoxical first you must believe

that you are in complete control of your

destiny

and that your success comes down only to

your own talent and hard work

but second you've got to know that's not

true

for you or anyone else so you have to

remember if you do

achieve success that luck played a

significant role and given your good

fortune

you should do what you can to increase

the luck of others

hey so i had an idea for what i could do

to increase the luck of others

and that is to give away a hundred

snatims kits to people who couldn't

otherwise afford them

so if you didn't know snatums is a

product that i invented and kickstarted

five years

ago it's a molecular modeling kit where

all the atoms snap together magnetically

now i made it because i really wanted to

tackle the misconception that bonds

store energy they don't it takes energy

to

break them and you can feel that with

snatums recently i completely

retooled snatums so there are small

holes where the magnets are

this allows them to touch directly

increasing the bonding strength so you

can form bigger

more stable molecules i call these

snatums

x and yes they are backwards compatible

with original snatums

so here's my idea for the next month you

can buy snatums for 10

off using the code give luck and for

each one sold i will give a kit to

someone who can't afford one

up to a limit of a hundred so i'll put

links and more details in the

description

and i really want to thank you for

watching and thank you for

all my good luck
