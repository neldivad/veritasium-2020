techie test question

later in the show on may 1st 2015

a group of scientists predicted that the

following november

we would see a star go supernova

billions of light years away

in a spiral galaxy designated sp1149

this was the first time anyone had ever

tried to predict

a supernova and for good reason they are

incredibly rare and unpredictable for a

star larger than eight times the mass of

our sun

a supernova marks the end of its life

cycle running out of fuel in its core

the star collapses in on itself and then

in the ensuing crush of matter

it violently explodes a supernova can be

as bright as a whole galaxy

and importantly the light emitted

follows a predictable pattern

it glows brightly for weeks and then

fades down over a period of months

but supernovae are rare in any galaxy of

a hundred billion stars or so

you can expect on average only two per

century

so just try picking the star that's

going to explode

now we can say how long a given star

will live based on its mass luminosity

and color temperature

these data pinpoint its stage of life in

a predictable life cycle

but the estimate of exactly when a large

star will go supernova

has big error bars take the red

supergiant beetlejuice for example

in our own milky way galaxy it is a

great candidate to go supernova

scientists think beetlejuice will

explode any day now in the next few

hundred thousand years when it does

it'll be so bright you can see it in the

daytime

and it will rival the full moon's

brightness at night

compared to the lifespan of a star a

hundred thousand years

is a brief window of time but for us

short-lived humans it may as well be

forever

so you might think it would have been a

tough sell when the scientists who

predicted we'd see a supernova in

november 2015

asked for time on the hubble space

telescope to take pictures of galaxy

sp1149

but their request was granted

they could image this part of the sky

roughly once a month starting on october

30th

before this the galaxy was too close to

the sun to point hubble at it

in this first image taken at the end of

october there is no supernova

the next image was taken on november

14th

again no supernova but in the third

image

taken on december 11th jackpot there's a

supernova

right where they predicted it would be

and almost exactly when they said it

would happen

so how did they manage to predict a

supernova almost

to the month well the truth is they had

seen

this same exact supernova before

not once not twice but four additional

times a year earlier and five months

before the predictions

hubble took this image see those four

bright dots

those are multiple images of that same

supernova

the reason we see the same supernova in

four different locations

is because there is a lens between us

and the exploding star

not a lens made of glass of course but a

gravitational lens

made of a huge amount of ordinary matter

and dark matter

gravitational lensing tends to magnify

distant sources

and increase their apparent brightness

as rays of light become concentrated

this smears the image of distant

galaxies into arcs

strands and all kinds of weird shapes

and of course

to some distant observer in another

galaxy the light from our own sun and

milky way galaxy may be similarly warped

in gravitational lensing there are three

essential components

the source the lens and the telescope

if the lens and the source are

spherically symmetric and if the source

lens and telescope

are perfectly aligned you get what's

known as an

einstein ring the light from the source

is bent around the lens equally

in all directions leading to the image

of a smeared out ring

if the source and the lens are

spherically symmetric but are not

perfectly aligned then what we end up

seeing is a break

in the einstein ring it splits into two

semi-circles

and if the source lens and telescope are

aligned but the lens is not

axially symmetric for example it could

have an elliptical shape

well then you get four images in the

shape of a cross

an einstein cross so what happened with

our supernova

is 9.3 billion years ago

a dying star in a galaxy far far away

went out with a bang

as a supernova the explosion sent out a

blast of light in all directions

about five billion years ago before the

earth even existed

that light encountered a very massive

object that warped

space-time it was a cluster of galaxies

called

macs j1149.5 plus

2223 yeah i know that's a mouthful but

the name just tells us where in the sky

it was discovered by the massive cluster

survey

this galaxy cluster is made up of lots

of massive substructures like

individual galaxies and halos of dark

matter

at some point as the light traveled

through this region it encountered an

elliptical galaxy

almost perfectly lined up with where the

earth would eventually be

and the gravitational deflection focused

light rays that were initially diverging

onto paths that converged at the earth

this is why we saw the same supernova in

four different locations

not only did the supernova appear at

four different places the images also

appeared at different times

relative to the first image the others

were delayed by periods ranging from

five days to

over three weeks and we could measure

this time delay because of the

distinctive light curve

of the supernova some of the images of

the explosion were further along in

their light curve than others

this was a particularly lucky discovery

it's the first time a multiply lensed

supernova has ever been observed

there are other objects that due to

gravitational lensing appear multiple

times on the sky like

multiple images of galaxies but these

objects don't change predictably with

time

so there's no way to use their images to

work out the relative time delay between

them

now one reason for the time delay

between the supernova images

is because the four paths the light took

were different lengths

so it just took the light longer to

travel further

but there is another reason which is

that light passing through curved

space-time

appears to travel more slowly relative

to an external observer

this is much less intuitive but it's a

well-established

and well-tested part of general

relativity back in 1964

irwin shapiro suggested it would be

possible to test this gravitational time

delay

by sending radar signals to venus and

measuring how long it takes for the echo

to come back

he calculated that due to the

gravitational influence of the sun

the signals would take an extra 200

microseconds

when venus was on the other side of the

sun compared to when it was close to us

this is solely a gravitational time

delay not related to the extra distance

the light has to travel

and within a couple years experimental

data revealed

the gravitational time delay for light

traveling past the sun

was exactly as predicted today

in order to accurately determine the

distance to the voyager and pioneer

spacecraft

this shapiro time delay must be taken

into account

now i want you to have a look at the

four supernova images again

do you notice how the same galaxy

appears three times

in this image that is the supernova's

host galaxy

it is itself lensed by the massive

galaxy cluster nacs j1149.5 plus

two two three in fact this cluster

lenses tens of galaxies so scientists

had been studying and

modeling the distribution of matter in

the cluster long before the supernova

they asked if we see these four images

of the supernova in one

image of its host galaxy when would the

supernova appear in these

other two images of the host galaxy and

using the models of mass distribution

and

general relativity they calculated that

in this image

the supernova would have appeared 20

years earlier

in 1995. now there are no close-up

pictures of this part of the sky from

1995 so

there is no way to check but in the

other image of the galaxy

they predicted the supernova would

appear again in about

one year's time almost exactly

when it showed up in that hubble image

this successful prediction is a

fantastic confirmation of our

understanding of light and gravity

on the scale of the whole universe but

it has even bigger

implications one of the hottest debates

in astronomy right now is

how fast is our universe actually

expanding

this is measured by the hubble constant

the rate at which distant galaxies are

receding away from each other

depending on their distance apart now

there are two main ways this measurement

has traditionally been made

one is to look for stars in the nearby

universe

whose absolute luminosity we know then

we can use how bright they appear to us

to determine how far away they are if

you combine this distance information

with how red-shifted their light is

you can work out how fast the universe

is expanding

this is known as the distance ladder

method and the value of the hubble

constant it produces

is around 74 kilometers per second per

megaparsec

meaning for every megaparsec that

separates two galaxies

they will on average be moving apart at

74 kilometers per second

the other way to measure the hubble

constant is to study the features

in the cosmic microwave background

radiation which is

essentially just a picture of the early

universe using the standard model of

cosmology which is called lambda cdm

we can work out how this early universe

picture would expand over time

the result obtained from this method

comes out to 67 kilometers per second

per megaparsec

substantially slower than the 74 found

via the other method

now over the years both of these

techniques have been refined

reducing their uncertainties but the

values

have not gotten closer together so at

this moment

the two values really seem different

they are

on the cusp of being a five sigma result

astrophysicist joseph silk has called it

a possible crisis for cosmology

but there are independent ways to

measure the hubble constant and one of

them

is to look at a multiply lensed

supernova and use the time delay between

their appearances

to work it out this was first proposed

by a norwegian astronomer sierra

refstall in 1964.

since this is the first observed

multiply lensed supernova it has become

known as

supernova ref stall calculations of the

hubble constant from this data

yield a value of 64 kilometers per

second per megaparsec

now although that result has large error

bars it is more in line with the

measurements of the cosmic microwave

background radiation than with the

distance ladder method

the thing i keep thinking about is how

strange

space is i mean i used to think of it

essentially like glass

fundamentally transparent with some

foggy regions or some slight distortions

but here we have space warping light on

multiple

curved trajectories making the same

event appear

in six different places on the sky

separated by

days weeks a year and 20 years

and what is contained in those

distortions is information about the

workings

of our entire universe

now on to my techie test question

which famous scientist criticized

newtonian gravity by saying

that gravity should be innate inherent

and essential to matter

so that one body may act upon another at

a distance through

a vacuum without the mediation of

anything else

is to me so great an absurdity that i
