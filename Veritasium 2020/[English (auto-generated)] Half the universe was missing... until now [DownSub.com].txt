more about them at the end of the show

until recently half the universe was

missing

or hidden or just undetected and no i'm

not talking about dark matter or dark

energy which make up

27 and 68 percent of our universe

respectively

no i'm talking about normal ordinary

matter which makes up

you and me and the planets and stars and

nebulae and basically

everything you can see and since most of

this stuff is made of protons and

neutrons which are forms of

baryons this has been known as the

missing baryon problem

we expect the universe to be made up of

five percent baryonic matter

but when we go looking we only find two

and a half percent

now the first question you're probably

asking is why should we expect the

universe to be five percent

ordinary baryonic matter in the first

place

the answer is because with that density

we can explain the relative abundances

of different elements that we observe in

the universe

specifically the ratio of deuterium to

hydrogen to helium

in the beginning like right after the

big bang

there were all of these neutrons and

protons whizzing around it was

incredibly hot and there was tons of

radiation the universe was

radiation dominated but as the universe

expanded

it cooled to the point where protons and

neutrons

could start fusing together a

particularly stable nucleus to form

would be helium-4 made of two neutrons

and two protons

the problem was to form helium-4 you

first have to form

deuterium one proton and one neutron and

this is a less stable nucleus and as

quickly as it formed

it would get smashed apart but by about

10 seconds after the big bang

the universe had cooled sufficiently

that deuterium

could form and as soon as it did it

would rapidly fuse

into helium the rate at which this

happened depended on the density of

matter in the early universe

the higher the density the faster this

fusion could occur

then by 20 minutes after the big bang

the temperature had dropped

low enough that fusion could no longer

occur

so at this point the elemental

abundances were locked in

like a snapshot of this moment there was

75

hydrogen and 25 helium by mass which

is basically still what we observe in

the universe today

of the hydrogen nuclei 26 out of every

million

were deuterium

what's amazing about deuterium is that

it's stable

it doesn't decay and there are no known

processes that can produce it in

significant quantities

since the big bang and that means

virtually all the deuterium in the

universe today

including the one out of every 6 000

hydrogen atoms in tap water

was created not in stars but in

the first 20 minutes after the big bang

when we look deep into space the oldest

light we can see

is the cosmic microwave background

radiation the

afterglow of the big bang which has been

traveling

through the universe unimpeded since

about 400

000 years after the big bang and so we

can literally

count up those photons and work out the

density of radiation

right after the big bang and using the

value of 26 deuterium nuclei

per million hydrogen nuclei well we

can work out the ratio of baryonic

matter to photons

and that is how we work out that there

should be about five percent

baryonic matter in the universe so in

the late 1990s

scientists went looking for all this

baryonic matter

it was a census of sorts they added up

all of the planets and stars and black

holes

galaxies dust clouds gas basically

everything you can see or infer exists

using a telescope

and what they found is that everything

that i normally think of as the actual

stuff in our universe it only makes up

barely 20 percent of all the baryonic

matter

so where is the rest well

not all ordinary matter is glowing

brightly or is illuminated by nearby

stars

it's not dark matter but it is ordinary

matter

that is just in darkness and so if you

want to find

those baryons well one way is to use a

backlight

a bright source of light very far away

and that also means in the very early

universe

and quasars are the perfect backlight

their luminosity can be thousands of

times that of whole

galaxies the light comes from the

accretion disk of a supermassive black

hole

at the center of an early galaxy as it

engulfs

all this matter and since it is so

distant

the light we receive from quasars is

heavily redshifted

for example the light emitted when a

hydrogen atom goes from its first

excited state to its ground state the

lyman alpha transition

it produces ultraviolet light of around

121.6 nanometers in a lab

but from a quasar it can be observed as

a peak

in their spectrum at over 560 nanometers

that is yellow light what's fascinating

is if you look to the left of this peak

you see many

little dips these are absorption lines

created by

neutral hydrogen atoms that lie along

our line of sight with the quasar

when light from the quasar reaches

neutral hydrogen

the photons that can excite the

electrons from the ground state to the

first excited state

are absorbed this is the same lyman

alpha transition

but since these patches of hydrogen gas

are closer to us

they are less red-shifted so the notches

they make in the spectrum

are at shorter and shorter wavelengths

the closer the gas is

to us this has been described

as the lyman alpha forest

it's like a one-dimensional map that

shows us

where and how much neutral hydrogen gas

lies along the line connecting us to the

quasar

adding all of that neutral hydrogen gas

into our baryon budget brings us

almost to 50 percent so where

is the other half of the baryons well

computer simulations of the entire

universe

suggested they are out there just in

between the galaxies

in these sheets or filaments and they're

very spread out just

one to ten particles per cubic meter

plus these particles are ionized so they

don't absorb the light

like the neutral hydrogen gas and

they're in a temperature range

between about 100 000 and 10 million

kelvin

a range astronomers like to refer to as

warm hot

so this is known as the warm hot

intergalactic medium or

whim for short but finding the whim

has been a real challenge because

they're ionized because of their

temperature they only

emit or absorb in the high energy uv or

low energy x-rays now some people have

used

very sophisticated techniques to try to

find the whim

but then recently a naturally occurring

physical phenomenon

allowed us to find all of the missing

baryons

let's find out how first we need to talk

lightning and i promise this is related

okay so did you know that it's possible

to detect lightning from the other side

of the earth this is because lightning

produces a

flash of electromagnetic radiation in

all parts of the spectrum

i mean we see the white light but

there's also broad spectrum

radio waves which are released and if

you were nearby you could detect those

as

a pulse but the very low frequency radio

waves can actually travel

up and out of the atmosphere and they

get guided along the earth's magnetic

field lines

out several radii from the earth and

then back down

where they can be detected in the other

hemisphere except

if they're detected there they don't

come in as a single pulse

instead they are spread out as a

whistler

now if you play these radio waves

through a speaker we can actually hear

them so

listen to this

[Music]

you hear that descending tone that

sounds like a

sci-fi laser gun yeah that is lightning

on the other side

of the earth so what's happening here

well as the radio waves travel through

the earth's magnetosphere

they encounter free electrons which

slows them down

and more for the lower frequency waves

this is dispersion just as a prism

separates white light into its component

colors

the plasma in the magnetosphere

separates the radio waves

into its component frequencies low

frequencies are slowed down more than

high frequencies

so what started as a pulse ends up as a

whistler

and the amount of dispersion tells you

how many free electrons that radio wave

had to pass through to reach the

detector now just imagine

we could do something very similar to

find all the ionized baryons in the

universe

all we would need is a bright flash

of radio waves somewhere in the distant

universe

and as if on cue in 2007 astronomers

found the first

fast radio burst which is just what it

sounds like a very

short duration pulse of intense

radio waves and it came from the deep

universe from other galaxies now these

pulses can be

incredibly powerful i'm talking billions

or trillions of times as powerful as the

sun but they last

for on order of a millisecond we don't

really know what creates them though

some people suspect that it's magnetars

or

neutron stars or some sort of collision

between

these very powerful massive objects like

black holes and

neutron stars but for our purposes

all we need to know is that those

flashes exist

and that we can use them to look at

their dispersion and figure out

how many ionized baryons are between us

and the source

and this is exactly what one recent

paper did in

nature they plotted out the dispersion

measure of

several of these fast radio bursts

versus the redshift of their host

galaxy and what they found was sure

enough

the further out these fast radio bursts

were the more dispersed

their signal when it reached the earth

and in fact using their measurements

they were able to estimate the

total baryonic matter that is out there

and that includes all the ionized

particles in the whim

and they found that it was five percent

they found the missing baryons roughly

50 percent of them

are in that warm hot intergalactic

medium

and so this validates what we had been

thinking the whole time

you know what surprised me in making

this video was realizing

just how little of the ordinary matter

from the big bang ended up in things

like stars and galaxies what i normally

consider

as the stuff of the universe no that's

only like 10 or 20 percent of all the

baryonic matter

so it turns out the formation of these

interesting structures

is a really inefficient process but this

finding is

yet another triumph for science those

computer simulations run decades ago

turned out largely

to be correct and so everyone involved

should be congratulated

but this also highlights for me the

difference between scientists and

non-scientists

i feel like non-scientists like being

right they like

when things turn out the way they were

expecting but scientists on the other

hand

they want things to work out not the way

they expected

because that's the way we get clues into

what new physics

is still out there to be discovered i

guess for now we'll have to be content

with being right

hey this video was sponsored by kiwiko

which i'm really

excited about because i've been using

their monthly crates since the beginning

of the year with my four-year-old he got

it as a christmas present

and i've got to say they have been a

great resource for learning at home

each crate has super cool hands-on

projects that are fun to make and

they expose kids to steam concepts

that's science technology

engineering art and math now each box

includes all the supplies needed meaning

no extra trips to the store and kiwi co

offers

eight subscription lines for different

age groups and topics

they sent me some of the older age group

crates to try out and i had a lot of fun

uh making this this is a planetarium and

something you might not know is kiwico

is not only a subscription service you

can browse their store and purchase

individual projects or value packs for

different ages

no subscription required so let's talk

about why kiwico is so useful right now

i mean anyone who has been at home with

kids over the past few months

knows just how important it is to get

them engaged in something other than

a screen the summer brain drain happens

every year but

it is especially challenging right now

with disruptions to school and

online learning just not being as good

as you know in in-person hands-on

learning

now what i know from my own experience

is my son loves making kiwico projects

with me

he has a lot of fun and doesn't even

realize he's learning what do you see

you know one day we will talk about the

missing baryons but for right now these

projects

are a great way for us to connect and

learn together so if you want to try it

out you can get 20

off everything in the kiwi coast store

using code veritasium

or go to kiwico.com veritasium i'll put

that link in the description

so i really want to thank kiwiko for

supporting me and i want to thank you

for watching
