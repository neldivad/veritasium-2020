a portion of this video was sponsored by

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,609
Norton 360 classical mechanics is great

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:08,340
if you know the state of a system say

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,349
the position and velocity of a particle

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,840
then you can use an equation Newton's

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,280
second law to calculate what that

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,460
particle will do in the future in

8
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,600
quantum mechanics if you know the

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,000
quantum state of a particle that is its

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,800
wave function you can use the

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,539
Schrodinger equation to calculate what

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,550
that particle will do in the future

13
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,310
usually it spreads out over time as it

14
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,470
is doing here note to make this

15
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,020
animation we really solved the

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,180
Schrodinger equation so there's a

17
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,670
beautiful symmetry here if you know the

18
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,190
initial state you can use an equation to

19
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,440
evolve that state smoothly and

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,710
continuously into the future the problem

21
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,690
is in quantum mechanics we never

22
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,760
actually observe the wave function like

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,820
this instead when we measure it we find

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,030
the particle at a single point in space

25
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,649
so how are we to reconcile the

26
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,750
spread-out wavefunction evolving

27
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,250
smoothly under the Schrodinger equation

28
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,830
with this point like particle detection

29
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,530
now I think it's understandable that

30
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,000
when the founders of quantum theory

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,220
approached this problem they considered

32
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,619
the measurement more real than the

33
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,080
wavefunction after all the measurement

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,060
was something we had actually observed

35
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,150
and it matches our experience of a world

36
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,509
of matter particles it was harder to say

37
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,630
what the wavefunction was exactly

38
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,280
Schrodinger formulated his wave equation

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,549
because scientists notably debroglie

40
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,600
suspected that matter has wave-like

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,600
properties but it took a third physicist

42
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,030
Max Born to propose how we should

43
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,880
interpret the wave function at each

44
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,740
point in space the wave function has a

45
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,110
complex amplitude essentially just a

46
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,689
real number plus an imaginary number Max

47
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,220
Born suggested if you take that

48
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,560
amplitude and square it you get the

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,570
probability of finding the particle

50
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,090
there the fact that you have to square

51
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,040
the amplitude actually appears as a last

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,530
minute footnote in boran's paper but

53
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,380
that is how probability was introduced

54
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,140
into the core of our picture of reality

55
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,780
that's a pretty big philosophical leap I

56
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,610
mean no longer is the universe

57
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,630
deterministic

58
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,550
this made a lot of scientists especially

59
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,460
Einstein uncomfortable but the born rule

60
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,860
as it is now called remains at the heart

61
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,180
of quantum mechanics because it is

62
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,610
spectacularly successful at predicting

63
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,100
the outcomes of experiments so the way

64
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,300
quantum mechanics came to be understood

65
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,910
and the way I learned it is that there

66
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,580
are two sets of rules when you're not

67
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,830
looking the wave function simply evolves

68
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,850
according to the Schrodinger equation

69
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,190
but when you are looking when you make a

70
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,350
measurement the wavefunction collapses

71
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,750
suddenly and irreversibly and the

72
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,670
probability of measuring any particular

73
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,010
outcome is given by the amplitude of the

74
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,510
wave function associated with that

75
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,720
outcome squared now Schrodinger himself

76
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,750
hated this formulation which is actually

77
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,060
why he invented the famous Schrodinger's

78
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,640
cat thought experiment put a cat in a

79
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,330
box with a radioactive atom add a

80
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,530
radiation detector that triggers the

81
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,740
release of poisonous cyanide gas now

82
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,600
although it was only meant as a thought

83
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,490
experiment Schrodinger helpfully notes

84
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,040
this device must be secured against

85
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,800
direct interference by the cat anyway

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,110
the whole point of the experiment is to

87
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,910
magnify the state of the atom up to the

88
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,380
state of something macroscopic and

89
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,570
tangible he could have picked anything

90
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,580
it didn't have to be alive but

91
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,610
Schrodinger selected a cat if the atom

92
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,040
decays the detector detects radiation

93
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,040
releases the poison and the cat dies if

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,230
the atom doesn't decay the detector

95
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,030
doesn't detect radiation poison is not

96
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,030
released and the cat remains alive since

97
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,980
the state of the cat and detector

98
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,080
apparatus are directly tied to the state

99
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,340
of the atom we say they are entangled

100
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,870
where things get weird is that according

101
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,460
to quantum mechanics the state of the

102
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,620
atom does not have to be either decayed

103
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,870
or not decayed generally it's in a

104
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,300
superposition of both decayed and not

105
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,850
decayed at the same time assuming no

106
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,790
measurements have been made this

107
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,020
superposition state of the atom gets

108
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,960
entangled with the detector and then the

109
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,200
cat so after some time the wavefunction

110
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,210
of everything inside the box is in a

111
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,579
superposition of the atom has not

112
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,890
decayed poison not released cat a live

113
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,040
state and the atom has decayed poison

114
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,430
released cat dead

115
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,800
date so according to quantum mechanics

116
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,000
the cat really is both alive and dead at

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,430
the same time only when we open the box

118
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,960
and make a measurement does the

119
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,000
wavefunction collapse and the cat

120
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,180
actually becomes either dead or alive

121
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,699
these days Schrodinger's cat is often

122
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,070
used as a way to show how weird quantum

123
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,840
mechanics is but that wasn't

124
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,150
Schrodinger's point he wanted to show

125
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,490
that quantum mechanics as formulated was

126
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,520
wrong so taking up Schrodinger's

127
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,410
argument in this video I want to show

128
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,060
that there is a better way to think

129
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,410
about Schrodinger's cat

130
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,539
in fact a better way to think about

131
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:03,699
quantum mechanics entirely that I'd

132
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:07,030
argue is more logical and consistent to

133
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,009
get there we have to examine the three

134
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,930
essential components of Schrodinger's

135
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,570
cat superposition entanglement and

136
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,849
measurement to see if any of them is

137
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,400
flawed the superposition is the idea

138
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,080
that quantum objects can be in two

139
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,240
different states at the same time this

140
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,250
seems like a crazy idea and something

141
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,860
we'd never observe but we do indirectly

142
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,349
with the double slit experiment fire

143
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:31,270
individual electrons through two slits

144
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,520
at a screen and the pattern you see is

145
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,169
not just the sum of electrons going

146
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,000
separately through one slit and the

147
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,580
other slit it is an interference pattern

148
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,000
we are forced to conclude that a single

149
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,729
electron somehow goes through one slit

150
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,039
and the other slit simultaneously

151
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:51,099
this is superposition of course it's

152
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:52,720
easy to understand superposition with

153
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,479
waves they are spread out in space and

154
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:58,030
it's clear how the peak of a wave from

155
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,889
one slit cancels with the trough of the

156
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:01,900
wave from another slit to produce the

157
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,300
interference pattern and luckily we know

158
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,099
that when we're not looking electrons

159
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,710
are represented by a wave the wave

160
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,199
function the double slit experiment then

161
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,060
is concrete evidence that this wave

162
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,039
enables individual electrons to pass

163
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,099
through both slits at the same time so

164
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:21,520
superposition is on solid ground the

165
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,919
next concept is entanglement consider

166
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,659
two electrons fired toward each other

167
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:28,300
with equal and opposite velocities we

168
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,650
know they will scatter off each other

169
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,050
but we don't know exactly how their

170
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,000
trajectories are given by spread out

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,590
wave functions that only give us

172
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,050
probabilities

173
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,729
but as soon as we measure the momentum

174
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:41,400
of one of the electrons we immediately

175
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,979
know the momentum of the other one it

176
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,110
must be equal and opposite otherwise

177
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,639
conservation of momentum would be

178
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,389
violated now this may seem obvious but

179
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:53,460
consider that before the measurement the

180
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,139
momentum of each electron was in a

181
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,039
superposition of states measuring one

182
00:06:58,039 --> 00:06:59,610
instantaneously collapsed the

183
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,949
wavefunction of the other and this would

184
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:03,840
be true even if those electrons were

185
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,930
light-years apart these electrons are

186
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,990
entangled what's really going on here is

187
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,449
that after interacting the electrons do

188
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,460
not have separate wave functions at all

189
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,370
they are described by a single wave

190
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,680
function and this is what it means to be

191
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,050
entangled this explains why measuring

192
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,060
one immediately affects the state of the

193
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,130
other one because the single wave

194
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,949
function has collapsed in fact if we

195
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,330
were being rigorous we'd have to say

196
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,849
that there is only one wave function the

197
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:35,009
wave function of the entire universe

198
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:38,460
which includes absolutely everything but

199
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,469
in the case of isolated unentangled

200
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:42,719
quantum particles we can reasonably talk

201
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:44,550
about their individual wave functions

202
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,259
and then once they interact with

203
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,509
something else entanglement is the

204
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,449
result so what we've seen is

205
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:53,279
superposition is really the same thing

206
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,590
as describing systems with waves an

207
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,139
entanglement means that after particles

208
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,060
interact they are described by a single

209
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,000
wave function these are fundamental

210
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,560
parts of quantum theory describing

211
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,719
systems with wave functions that evolve

212
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,150
according to the Schrodinger equation

213
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,880
which leaves only measurement remember

214
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,340
the measurement postulate was added as a

215
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,380
second set of rules to connect the

216
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,389
mathematics of quantum mechanics to what

217
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,810
we actually observe but doesn't it seem

218
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,969
weird that there should be one rule for

219
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,469
how systems evolve when we're not

220
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:27,659
looking and a different rule for when we

221
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:30,900
are when you boil it down measurement is

222
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,909
just the interaction of one quantum

223
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,770
system electrons and photons with

224
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,049
another quantum system and we know

225
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,779
exactly how to deal with that we simply

226
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,789
evolve their wave functions according to

227
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,550
the Schrodinger equation so what if we

228
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,949
throw out all the rules associated with

229
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:49,199
measurement well then in the

230
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:50,900
Schrodinger's cat thought experiment

231
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,910
the radioactive atom in a superposition

232
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,370
of decayed and not decayed gets

233
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,920
entangled with the detector and in turn

234
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,860
the cat now remember we are also made of

235
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,720
electrons and atoms which obey the laws

236
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,670
of quantum mechanics so we are quantum

237
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,190
mechanical - so when we open the box

238
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,740
there is no measurement no wavefunction

239
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,020
collapse we simply get entangled with

240
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,029
the state of everything inside the box

241
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:18,230
so we see the cat alive and we see the

242
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,680
cat dead now how is that possible I'm

243
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,960
guessing you've never seen both an alive

244
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,960
and dead cat before but the solution is

245
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,910
it's because the you that saw the cat

246
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,950
alive and the you that saw it dead

247
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,310
actually inhabit separate worlds by that

248
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,950
I mean they exist in their own complete

249
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,660
realities and those realities will never

250
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,240
interact but where did these separate

251
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,700
worlds come from well something I

252
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,170
haven't mentioned yet are all the

253
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,850
particles of the environment the air

254
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,310
molecules photons everything that we are

255
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,279
not keeping track of if a quantum object

256
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,380
in a superposition gets entangled with

257
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,690
the environment it is said to undergo

258
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,930
environmental decoherence this branches

259
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,040
the wave function of the universe

260
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,180
essentially

261
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,310
splitting the universe into two slightly

262
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,430
different copies so a more realistic

263
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,290
account of Schrodinger's cat goes like

264
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,050
this the radioactive atom evolves from

265
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,510
100% not decayed into a quantum

266
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,029
superposition of decayed and not decayed

267
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:19,760
the detector becomes entangled with this

268
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,240
superposition state of the atom but the

269
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,250
detector is being bombarded by all these

270
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,529
air molecules and photons in the box

271
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:29,480
which would bounce off differently if it

272
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,730
is detected radiation than if it hasn't

273
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,610
so almost immediately the detector

274
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,709
becomes entangled with the state of the

275
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:39,740
environment it D coheres branching the

276
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,279
wavefunction in to at that moment you

277
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,220
are split into two identical copies one

278
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,020
entangled with each outcome of the

279
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,300
experiment you continue to be identical

280
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,430
until you open the box but in this case

281
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,620
the cat actually is alive or dead you

282
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,330
were just finding out by opening the box

283
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,970
what we are unaware of is that the other

284
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,220
outcome also happened just to someone

285
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,200
who is not you anymore I mean both

286
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,950
observers

287
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,960
came from you but they are no longer you

288
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,910
and they're no longer identical to each

289
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,410
other this interpretation of quantum

290
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,240
mechanics is called many worlds and it

291
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,760
was formulated by Hugh Everett and if

292
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,410
it's true the branching of the

293
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,210
wavefunction is happening all the time

294
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,850
so frequently in fact that the rate may

295
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,520
well be infinite creating infinite

296
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,500
subtly different worlds all the time may

297
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,440
sound implausible to put it mildly but

298
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,360
consider that all those worlds are

299
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,070
naturally part of the mathematics of

300
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,590
quantum mechanics many worlds just takes

301
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,990
them seriously to get rid of them

302
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,970
requires something like the collapse of

303
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,760
the wavefunction and the point is our

304
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,860
experience of reality would be the same

305
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,930
in the many-worlds picture as it is if

306
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,090
the wavefunction collapses but the

307
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,310
formalism is so much cleaner and more

308
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,380
elegant all we have are wave functions

309
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,360
that evolved under the Schrodinger

310
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,730
equation the implication is that the

311
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,530
founders of quantum theory may have got

312
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,500
it exactly backwards the wavefunction is

313
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,440
the complete picture of reality and our

314
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,810
measurement is just a tiny fraction of

315
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,550
it the part we become entangled with

316
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,680
when we interact with a quantum object

317
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,230
in a superposition the universe also

318
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,450
goes back to being deterministic every

319
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,940
outcome happens a hundred percent of the

320
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,340
time it only doesn't look that way to us

321
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,770
because we only experience our tiny

322
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,130
sliver of the multiverse now I imagine

323
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,020
that a lot of you have questions and

324
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,450
possibly objections to this so I went to

325
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:37,880
the expert okay so I wanted to make this

326
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,740
video about many worlds but I was

327
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,600
concerned I was gonna screw it up so

328
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,850
I've come here to meet Caltech professor

329
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,830
Sean Carroll who has literally written

330
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,470
the book on many worlds look something

331
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,880
deeply hidden available wherever books

332
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,900
available

333
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,010
let's ask probably the common sort of

334
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,770
YouTube questions the good arguments

335
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,130
against this yes how many how many

336
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,020
worlds are there now the first one is

337
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,370
energy energization

338
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,980
how is energy conserved is completely

339
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,610
clear in the math the energy of the

340
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,860
whole wavefunction is a hundred percent

341
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,440
super-duper conserved but there's a

342
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,300
difference between the energy of the

343
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,699
whole way

344
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:19,889
function and the energy that people in

345
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:22,799
each branch perceive so what you should

346
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,350
think of is not duplicating the whole

347
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,509
universe but taking a certain amount of

348
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:29,399
universe and sort of subdividing it

349
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,279
slicing it into two pieces the pieces

350
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,919
look identical from the inside except

351
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,269
that one has spin up the one has spin

352
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:38,129
down or something like that but they're

353
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,109
really contributing less than the

354
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:41,819
original to the total energy of

355
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:44,100
everything let's ask the question about

356
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,169
how many words there are how frequently

357
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:48,509
are they branching right we have no idea

358
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:50,579
there's a short answer to this and I

359
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,600
think it's embarrassing that we don't

360
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,089
have any idea it's certainly often it's

361
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:56,249
certainly a lot right the universe

362
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:58,139
branches whenever a quantum system in

363
00:13:58,139 --> 00:13:59,850
superposition becomes entangled with its

364
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:04,199
environment so you have atomic nuclei in

365
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:06,269
your body that are radioactive they

366
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:08,759
decay 5000 times a second there's a

367
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,309
radioactive decay in your body every one

368
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,929
of those either decays or doesn't do you

369
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:14,459
think of it as a superposition once it

370
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,049
decays it sort of interacts with what's

371
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:18,509
around it becomes entangled and the

372
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:20,249
universe branches its wave function

373
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:22,499
right so branching is happening many

374
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:24,059
many times a second just because a

375
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:26,489
radioactive decays in your body now is

376
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:29,699
it happening infinitely often we don't

377
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:31,799
know because we don't know whether the

378
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:34,230
total number of possible branches is

379
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,259
infinitely big or finite its joy mungus

380
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:39,179
by any stretch there's plenty of room

381
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,309
for all these branches to exist and it

382
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:43,410
might very well be finite but that the

383
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,179
details hinge on things we don't

384
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:47,069
understand about quantum gravity and

385
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:48,509
cosmology and the theory of everything

386
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:50,850
and all that stuff so it's a big number

387
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,439
but we don't know how big let's deal

388
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:54,209
with the misconception that many-worlds

389
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:56,549
means everything that could possibly

390
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:59,609
happen happens yeah that's not true many

391
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:01,559
worlds means the wavefunction obeys the

392
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,669
Schrodinger equation that's what it

393
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,619
means the Schrodinger equation predicts

394
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:07,379
many things could potentially happen but

395
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:10,109
not everything so for example an

396
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,699
electron will never convert into a

397
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,609
proton it would violate conservation of

398
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:16,589
mass conservation of charge all of these

399
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:18,029
things things of the Schrodinger

400
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:20,609
equation gives zero probability to ever

401
00:15:20,609 --> 00:15:22,289
happening what about you becoming

402
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,509
president yes that could happen there

403
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:26,069
there is a world in which you're

404
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:28,049
president there is a world well to be

405
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:30,010
SuperDuper clear

406
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,540
not be me who is president Raney a

407
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,460
version of me right right but there is

408
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,590
the branching happens your those are two

409
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,700
separate people now but there is a

410
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,140
version of you who is currently

411
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,640
president yes that's right and who was

412
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,440
tweeting it's a very low amplitude world

413
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,050
it's a very small probability but it's

414
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,760
there yes I mean I think this is the way

415
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,440
in which it feels more complicated than

416
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,850
or it feels more ridiculous then

417
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,380
Copenhagen because Copenhagen's like

418
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,780
there's just one world this is it that's

419
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,970
what you experience and but look the

420
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,010
universe the good old universe

421
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,990
forget about quantum mechanics okay just

422
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,190
like the cows mantra universe where we

423
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,990
see all the galaxies and everything we

424
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,550
don't see the whole universe we see a

425
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,350
finite amount of it because light moves

426
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,820
at the speed of lights is a place beyond

427
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,400
which we can't see the universe could be

428
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,860
infinitely big we don't know

429
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,140
it's certainly very plausible universe

430
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,180
is infinitely big it's plausible that

431
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,730
everywhere in the universe looks more or

432
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,040
less like what we see with galaxies and

433
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,520
stars in the whole bit if that's true

434
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,410
there's an infinite number of copies of

435
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,380
people exactly like you some of them are

436
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,030
presidents some of them are winning NBA

437
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,290
championships some of them are

438
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,510
supermodels whatever this just because

439
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,890
there's a lot of different shuffling

440
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,870
around of the atoms okay has nothing to

441
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,280
do with quantum mechanics or weirdness

442
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,640
does that bother you does that like rub

443
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,270
you the wrong way

444
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,690
kind of I think but but but I agree it's

445
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,540
less weird than the quantum idea and I

446
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,150
think in both cases it's it's because

447
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,130
you know human beings there's some

448
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,320
cognitive bias I don't know what it's

449
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,000
called but there's a cognitive bias that

450
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,250
says the only probabilities for anything

451
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,060
or 0% 50% 100% and when I tell you

452
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,430
something can happen but the probability

453
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,750
is really really really really really

454
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,180
really really really low you feel like

455
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,980
but it could happen

456
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,209
let me focus on that come on that

457
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,980
possibility that it happens I'm like no

458
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,920
don't do that it's just not sufficiently

459
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,390
probable that it's worth worrying about

460
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,270
in any way when the world branches here

461
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,819
does it branch instantly far away

462
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,060
the answer is it's up to you this is the

463
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,190
annoying part of the answer I can write

464
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,530
down a description in which the

465
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,000
branching happens instantly throughout

466
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,070
all of space I use that description to

467
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,960
make predictions about what people will

468
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,990
see all those predictions come out

469
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,450
percent completely true I can write an

470
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,160
alternative description in which the

471
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,630
branching sort of spreads out of the

472
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,790
speed of light and I make a different

473
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,020
set of predictions but guess what

474
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,490
they're exactly the same predictions

475
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,020
there's no difference between what those

476
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,080
two pictures actually predict and what

477
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,110
this is reflecting is God doesn't know

478
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,070
about branches

479
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,870
there's the wave function of the

480
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,970
universe that's all it really exists

481
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:06,540
okay

482
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,340
breaking the wave function the universe

483
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,470
into different pieces that you and I

484
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,110
call branches or Worlds is very

485
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,720
convenient for us human beings but

486
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,360
that's all it is it's not built into the

487
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,210
fabric of reality itself it's just like

488
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,580
it's exactly like for the air in this

489
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,730
room rather than listing the position

490
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,110
and velocity of every single air

491
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,880
molecule I just tell you the temperature

492
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,929
and the pressure and things like that

493
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:33,420
right that's a convenient description

494
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,160
for us human beings it's not the full

495
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,380
description of the reality and branches

496
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,059
are exactly the same way so if you get

497
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:40,260
annoyed that there's two different ways

498
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,540
of describing the branching you have to

499
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,530
remember that the whole idea of

500
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,790
branching is just a human convenience

501
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,140
hey this portion of the video is

502
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,570
sponsored by Norton 360 a global leader

503
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,270
in cyber safety Norton 360 comes with

504
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,130
multiple layers of protection for your

505
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,200
devices not just antivirus and

506
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,450
anti-spyware but also things like dark

507
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,910
web monitoring powered by LifeLock this

508
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,309
software monitors the dark web for uses

509
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:07,679
of your personal information now of

510
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,870
course no one can prevent all cybercrime

511
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,400
but it's important to take a

512
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,929
multi-layered approach to protection

513
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:14,880
because cyber threats are constantly

514
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,429
evolving that's why Norton 360 also

515
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:19,320
comes with a virtual private network or

516
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,200
VPN a VPN creates a private encrypted

517
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,700
data tunnel that helps prevent cyber

518
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,010
criminals from hacking into your Wi-Fi

519
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,600
and intercepting the data you are

520
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,580
sending and receiving this is

521
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,200
particularly useful when you're using

522
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,780
public Wi-Fi I like to use it when I'm

523
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,880
traveling so when I'm connecting to

524
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,160
Wi-Fi is in hotels or airports or coffee

525
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,770
shops it just gives me that extra peace

526
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,290
of mind right now you can get up to 60%

527
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,630

529
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,470
Norton 360 has graciously given me

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,750
Norton 360 deluxe to try out for myself

531
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,330
and I'm really enjoying it so I want to

532
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:54,750
thank

533
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,490
